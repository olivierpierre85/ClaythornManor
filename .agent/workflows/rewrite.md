description: Rewrite dialogue or narration in a specific file properly, applying character styles, 1920s British English, and formatting rules.
---

1. **Identify the Target File**
   - Identify the specific file (e.g., a `.rpy` script file) that the user wants to rewrite.
   - Use `view_file` to read the contents of the target file.

2. **Analyze and Rewrite Content**
   - Focus on dialogue and narration blocks (enclosed in triple quotes `"""` or `'''`).
   - **Crucial Rules for Rewriting**:
     - Standard British English grammar and spelling (1920s period appropriate, but not overly antiquated).
     - **Character Voice**: Adapt the tone based on the character speaking or the file's naming context (e.g., doctor = proper middle-class; lad = informal, subtle slang; psychic = flowery; captain = formal/direct; drunk = incoherent/educated mix; host = aristocratic; nurse/broken = proper middle-class).
     - Do **not** use semicolons in dialogue or narration.
     - Use simple straight quotes (`'`) instead of smart/typographic apostrophes (`’`).
     - Maintain a blank line after each sentence within Ren'Py dialogue blocks.

3. ** Rewrite **
     - Finish dialogs and correct the others for style.
     - Don't be afraid to replace text, add more sentences or delete unuseful ones. This is not a grammar correction, but a full editorial rewriting.
