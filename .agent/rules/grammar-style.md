This project is a renpy game about a murder happening in a Scottish Manor in 1920s. So answer with a british english grammar and vocabulary.

## Coding & Text Conventions
- All dialogue and narration must use standard British English grammar and spelling.
- When fixing or generating dialogue, use triple quotes (`"""`) to separate lines, as per project settings.
- Do not use semicolons in dialogue or narration.
- Using simple quote (') instead of ’
- File and variable names use snake_case.
- In renpy dialogue, there is a blank line after each sentence.

## Character style and tone
- Maintain the tone and level of English in existing text; do not simplify or overcomplicate.
- Always change style when necessary.
- Characters have distinct styles and tones (see below); maintain these when writing or editing dialogue.
- When rewriting dialogue, ensure it fits the character's established voice.
- each text block starts with the code name of the character, except when it is the inner voice speaking. In the case, the character used must be guessed based on the file or function name. (example: label doctor_day1_evening, the inner character is the doctor)

### Generic Guidelines
- Note that we are in 1924, so the language must be adapted to the time period. But try not to overdo it, dialogs that feels too antiquated, even if correct for the period, may sound funny when it shouldn't (example "to-day" instead of "today")

### doctor (Daniel Baldwin)
- Classic middle-class with proper manners

### lad (Ted Harring)
- He uses a more informal language. He tries to hide it but sometimes uses slang and contractions (make it subtle).

### psychic (Amelia Baxter)
- Use a more full and flowery language

### Captain (Sushil Sinha)
- Formal and straight to the point

### drunk (Samuel Manning)
- Mostly incoherent when drunk (most of the time) yet sometimes educated, 

### host (Lady Claythorn)
- A bit aristocratic but not too much

### nurse (Rosalind Marsh)
- Classic middle-class with proper manners

### broken (Thomas Moody)
- Classic middle-class with proper manners
