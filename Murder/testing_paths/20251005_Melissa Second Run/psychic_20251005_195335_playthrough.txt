As I approach my destination, I read the letter that has brought me on this trip for the tenth time.
Letter: 5th September, 1924
Letter: Dear Mr Harring,
Letter: I am pleased to announce that you have been selected as one of the recipients of the "Exceptional Act of Bravery Award".
Letter: You'll be receiving the prize, along with six other courageous individuals, at a reception organised in your honour.
Letter: As a thank you, a weekend of leisure at Claythorn Manor has been planned for all of you to enjoy.
Letter: After which, a prize money of one thousand pounds in bearer's bond will be handed to you.
Letter: Please note that your presence is mandatory in order to receive the prize.
Letter: All you have to do is be at Aberdeen Station, on the 13th of October around 4PM, where someone will drive you to the manor.
Letter: Hoping ,.....
More information follows, but that's about the content of it.
It is signed by "Lady Claythorn".
I've never heard of her.
I couldn't really believe it at first.
I don't think I am that deserving. At least no more than hundreds of other guys in this country.
But no matter the reason, I can't possibly say no to this amount of money.
So I feel as if I do not have much choice.
But still, there is part of me thinking,
Maybe I never should have come.
As I step off the train, a man approaches me.
Footman: Welcome sir. Are you by any chance, heading to Claythorn Manor?
Ted Harring: Yes, as a matter of fact I am.
As proof, I hand him the letter that I still have in my hand.
Footman: Very well Sir. Let me assist you with your luggage and you can follow me into the car.
And just like that, we are on our way.
Ted Harring: So you are lady Claythorn's driver?
Footman: Yes, I mean,.. no.
Footman: I am actually her footman. I also drive people when necessary.
Ted Harring: Oh. The driver must be busy because of all the people coming I guess.
Ted Harring: Do you know how many people have been invited this weekend?
Footman: Well, ... I am not sure sir. Half a dozen at least I believe.
Footman: But I am sorry, I must concentrate on the road ahead. Lady Claythorn doesn't like it when I am distracted.
Ted Harring: Of course, I am sorry.
Footman: No need for apologies Sir.
I seem to have made him uneasy. Maybe he's not used to small talk with guests.
This feels odd, as I'm usually on the other end of this treatment.
I wonder how well I'll blend in with the other folks at the manor.
They might be used to this kind of service.
But then again, maybe not. Maybe Lady Claythorn likes helping people like me.
We'll see.
After we leave Aberdeen, we move into the countryside, then into what seems like a vast forest.
About twenty minutes later, all signs of human life disappear.
It's nothing but dense woodland as far as the eye can see.
The isolation makes me feel a bit uneasy, being so far from everywhere else.
And the look of an approaching storm in the sky only adds to my discomfort.
Eventually, an imposing mansion emerges on the horizon.
It's bigger than any house I've ever been in.
A big country house.
Everyone who was anyone in England used to have one.
Now I've heard a lot of people can't afford them anymore.
They are sold, turned into hotels, or even abandoned. Left there to rot.
What a shame.
As the driver unloads my luggage from the car, I approach the entrance, where a butler opens the door to welcome me.
I step into the most remarkable hall I've ever set foot in.
Butler: Welcome Sir.
Ted Harring: Hello, I am Ted Harring, I have been invited by Lady Claythorn..
Butler: Yes, of course Mr Harring.
Butler: Welcome to Claythorn Manor.
Butler: I am afraid you won't have time to change right now.
Butler: Everyone is already there, and dinner will be ready very soon.
Butler: So if you follow me into the tea room, you can join the rest of the party for some drinks.
Well, it's not like I have multiple changes of clothes anyway. So, I follow him.
As I step into the room, the butler loudly introduces me.
Butler: Mr Ted Harring!
Everyone turns their head towards me.
Some people nod in my direction, while others barely acknowledge my presence.
From afar, the butler provides me with a brief introduction to each guest.
Butler: The older man talking is from India, and his name is Sushil Sinha.
Butler: He is in conversation with Rosalind Marsh...
Butler: .. and with Daniel Baldwin. The man with the glasses.
Butler: Don't be alarmed by the man in the mask.
Butler: He is a war veteran named Thomas Moody.
Butler: The man sitting on the couch, looking rather exhausted is Samuel Manning.
Butler: The older lady in the corner of the room is Amelia Baxter.
Ted Harring: I don't see our host in the room.
Butler: Lady Claythorn is still busy at the moment.
Butler: You'll meet her at dinner.
After this introduction, he leaves me and goes to stand in the corner of the room.
Most of the guests are already engaged in conversation.
However, Amelia Baxter and Samuel Manning are alone.
They seem more approachable than the rest.
Menu Choice: Talk to Amelia Baxter
I am approaching the middle-aged woman.
Ted Harring: Nice to meet you, Miss Baxter. I am Ted Harring.
Amelia Baxter: Nice to meet you, Mr Harring.
Menu Choice: How old are you?
Amelia Baxter: I beg your pardon?
Amelia Baxter: Are you really asking me that? Were you raised in a barn?
Amelia Baxter: Only a person without any social skills would ask such a question of a respectable lady.
I mutter an apology and quickly change the subject.
Tutorial: Congratulations on discovering your first piece of information about a character!
Tutorial: Learning about characters is crucial in this game. You can find two types of information: essential and trivial.
Tutorial: To unlock a new playable character, it is necessary to learn all the essential facts about them.
Tutorial: Once you have acquired this knowledge, you will be able to restart the story from their perspective.
Tutorial: While conversing with a character can unlock certain information, some facts can only be revealed at specific moments in the story.
Tutorial: The "Characters" menu gives you an estimation of how much essential information has been unlocked, as well as a complete description of a character.
Tutorial: At the beginning, the descriptions are riddled with holes. It's up to you to fill those holes to reveal someone's true story.
Tutorial: Check out for yourself.
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for her
Menu Choice: Stand awkwardly in the corner
Tutorial: Wait, don't you hear something ticking?
Tutorial: If you haven't noticed it yet, look at the clock in the upper-left corner.
Tutorial: There, you can see the current time, as well as the day.
Tutorial: This helpful tool will move as the story progresses, for example, when you start a new chapter of this adventure.
Tutorial: Also, when you are faced with multiple choices, each action will take a different amount of time.
Tutorial: Since each scene has a limited duration, this means you won't always have the opportunity to explore every option on a list.
Tutorial: So make every choice count.
Tutorial: Also, there is no need to rush reading, the time spent on an choice is set and not dependent on the speed of your actions.
What is that? A gong?
Butler: Dinner is served. Please, follow me to the dining room.
Everyone takes a seat at the spot labelled with their names.
As I observe each person, Lady Claythorn makes her entrance into the room.
She looks younger than I imagined.
I don't know why, but I pictured an elderly, bored lady. Yet she looks nothing like that.’
Her clothes, which are the most impressive of anyone's in the room, make her status clear.
She proceeds to take her seat at the table.
Lady Claythorn: Welcome, everyone. My apologies for keeping you waiting.
Lady Claythorn: Now that we're all gathered, I'd like to express my gratitude once more.
Lady Claythorn: As you already know, you are here because of the heroic acts you've committed in the past.
Lady Claythorn: I've taken notice of these actions and felt it was my responsibility to extend a formal 'thank you.'
Lady Claythorn: I realize the invitation letter you received was somewhat vague, so let me clarify its contents now.
Lady Claythorn: My first gift to you is a stay at my manor.
Lady Claythorn: You'll be fully catered to, enjoying the most refined food, expertly prepared by my personal chef.
Lady Claythorn: During the three days we'll spend together, we'll also partake in various activities, which I'm sure you'll find enjoyable.
Lady Claythorn: My second gift is a sum of one thousand pounds, to be shared among you.
Lady Claythorn: This is my way of thanking those as selfless as yourselves, who help others without thought of reward.
Following her speech, our host settles back down in her chair.
After the speech, everyone appears pleased.
A few of the guests begin to express their appreciation to the host.
Lady Claythorn: Please, there's no need to thank me.
Lady Claythorn: The food will be served shortly.
Lady Claythorn: Enjoy your meal.
At that moment, the butler enters the room, accompanied by the footman.
They begin to serve the first dish and pour drinks for everyone.
The mood in the room gradually relaxes, and the sound of various conversations fills the space.
I turn my attention to the guests seated next to me.
I find myself sitting between Amelia Baxter and Daniel Baldwin.
Menu Choice: Eat in silence, like a sociopath
The dinner comes to an end.
The host explains that we can continue our discussion and enjoy drinks in the billiard room, or, for those tired from the journey, we can simply retire for the night.
Since I haven't seen my room yet, I should probably head there first.
I ask the footman to show me the way.
The footman escorts me up the grand staircase, leading me to the first floor.
Footman: Here you are, sir.
Footman: You've been assigned the "William The Conqueror" room.
Tutorial: Well done, you just found new information about the Manor.
Tutorial: As a result, additional details have been added to the Manor map to assist you in navigating the house.
Tutorial: You can access this information by navigating to the "Map" menu here.
I step into the bedroom.
It's more spacious than my apartment, and more luxurious than I could have ever imagined.
Footman: I hope the room suits your taste.
Ted Harring: This is ..., this is good, yes. Thank you.
The footman exits the room.
I look around in disbelief.
After a while, I unpack my modest luggage.
It does not take long. So, what should I do now?
Map Choice: Portrait Gallery
That's a creepy portrait gallery.
I don't recognize anyone, so I guess these are people from the Claythorn family.
Map Choice: Tea room
There is nobody here.
No need to stay any longer.
Map Choice: Meet the others in the billiard room
Except for Amelia Baxter, everyone from dinner is in this room.
I recognize Doctor Baldwin, sitting alone on a chair.
There's also an array of alcohol near the bar.
The remainder of the guests are clustered together, with Sushil Sinha leading the conversation.
The butler stands silently in a corner near them.
Menu Choice: Approach the large group of people
I walk towards the main group in the room.
Thomas Moody, Rosalind Marsh and Lady Claythorn are listening to the older Indian man.
Even the butler, who is standing on the corner next to them looks very interested in what is being said.
I join them.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Harring.
Sushil Sinha: I was just telling everyone here a story.
Sushil Sinha: Where was I?
Sushil Sinha: Oh Right.
Sushil Sinha: It was in June of 1900, so some of you might remember.
Sushil Sinha: In China, a group of rebels, called the "Boxers," had taken up arms against foreign presence in their country.
Sushil Sinha: They were a group of mostly peasants, poorly armed.
Sushil Sinha: We called them "Boxers" because of their use of martial arts in their fights.
This appears to be a long story.
If I stay, I might be stuck here for a while.
Menu Choice: Continue to listen anyway
Sushil Sinha: They managed to surround the Europeans and Japanese in the "International Legations" quarter, in China's capital, Beijing.
Sushil Sinha: There, the besieged did their best to resist the Chinese assaults, but it was obvious to everyone that they wouldn't last very long.
Sushil Sinha: In order to break the siege and rescue their compatriots, the largest foreign nations formed expeditions to help lift the siege of Beijing.
Sushil Sinha: I was part of the most important one, and the only successful one: The "Gaselee Expedition," named after Alfred Gaselee, the British expedition leader.
Sushil Sinha: It was a mish-mash of troops from eight different countries: Japan, The British Empire, The United States, France, Russia, German Empire, Italy, and Austria-Hungary.
Sushil Sinha: As an Indian officer, I was obviously part of the British army.
Sushil Sinha: We first landed in the old Chinese capital of Tianjin.
Sushil Sinha: Then we marched from there to reach Beijing, and rescue the civilians besieged there, as well as people from previous expeditions.
Sushil Sinha: The journey was a total nightmare.
Sushil Sinha: We endured a march of almost a hundred miles, where we were under constant attacks from Chinese troops.
Sushil Sinha: If that wasn't bad enough, some poorly led and confused soldiers, notably from the French army, often ended up shooting at their allies.
Sushil Sinha: But the worst part was the scorching heat.
Sushil Sinha: Even my fellow Indian soldiers were not immune to it, and many died of sunstroke.
Sushil Sinha: By the time we reached Beijing, our expedition of 20,000 soldiers was reduced to 10,000.
Sushil Sinha: By that time, the soldiers were angry, tired, and restless.
Sushil Sinha: They had started to commit such acts that I can't even repeat here.
Sushil Sinha: I was expecting the exactions of the Japanese and the Russians, who were known for their ruthlessness.
Sushil Sinha: But in the end, our proud "civilized" European nations fared no better.
Sushil Sinha: The final assault of the besieged was also an example of a lack of discipline among the soldiers and their commanders.
Sushil Sinha: Each country was supposed to attack a different gate of the city.
Sushil Sinha: But the Russians were not happy with their assigned choice of gate.
Sushil Sinha: So they woke up early and assaulted the closest gate to the legation quarters, where the Americans were supposed to be.
Sushil Sinha: They wanted to be the first army to reach the defenders, and so claim the glory of having liberated the city by themselves.
Sushil Sinha: Bloody fools.
Sushil Sinha: Luckily, in the end, we managed to conquer Beijing without too much trouble.
Sushil Sinha: We even entered the Imperial City and routed out the Empress.
Sushil Sinha: It was an undeniable victory, but the price paid was high.
Sushil Sinha: Afterwards, we stayed and occupied the city.
Sushil Sinha: To compensate themselves, soldiers went on a looting frenzy.
Sushil Sinha: Sadly, people in the British army also took part in it.
Sushil Sinha: But not in the same outrageous manner as other nations.
Sushil Sinha: At least, looting on the part of British troops was carried out in the most orderly fashion.
Sushil Sinha: We held loot auctions every day except Sunday in front of the main gate to the British Legation.
Sushil Sinha: It was the best way to compensate for the loss of our compatriots who had suffered the siege for three months.
Sushil Sinha: There was no way around it, I'm afraid.
Sushil Sinha: Well, in any case, that was my first campaign as a captain.
Sushil Sinha: And I do not regret it.
Sushil Sinha: I stayed a few more months in China to ensure the peaceful transition.
Sushil Sinha: In the end, my commanders were really pleased with me.
Sushil Sinha: So, I got to go to London to lead a training regiment near London.
Sushil Sinha: That was very rare for someone of Indian descent.
Sushil Sinha: In any case, that's why I live in England today.
Wait, that was the original question?
Why he is living in England?
That sure took long enough.
It's getting quite late now.
I'm exhausted from the trip.
Going back to my room is probably the best thing to do.
It's been a long day.
So I change and get directly into bed.
Almost instantly, I fall asleep.
I slept through the night.
The storm from yesterday has passed and the weather is clearer now.
After getting ready, I leave my room to have breakfast.
Most of the guests are already seated in the dining room.
There's a breakfast buffet set up.
I serve myself a plate with eggs, bacon, bread, and a few other items, not really following any specific order.
I have no idea if this is what I'm supposed to do.
I quietly take the same seat I had yesterday, hoping to go unnoticed.
Daniel Baldwin and Amelia Baxter are already present.
Amelia Baxter: Hello, Mr Harring. How are you?
Ted Harring: Very well, thank you.
Amelia Baxter: I was wondering if everyone would join us on time.
Amelia Baxter: There are still a few people missing.
Amelia Baxter: For instance, I don't think we'll see Mr Manning anytime soon.
Amelia Baxter: He was so drunk yesterday that I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't show up before noon.
Suddenly, Samuel Manning enters the room.
He stumbles to the buffet table and picks up a plate, visibly shaking.
Amelia Baxter: Well, I spoke too soon. Here he is. And in such a state.
Amelia Baxter: How dreadful.
At the same moment, the butler rushes into the room.
He goes to Lady Claythorn and whispers something in her ear.
I can tell it's not good news.
She looks shocked and worried.
She stands up and walks in my direction, then stops in front of the doctor.
Lady Claythorn: Doctor Baldwin, I'm sorry to interrupt your breakfast, but would you mind coming with me?
Lady Claythorn: We need your assistance.
Without hesitation, Daniel Baldwin stands up.
Daniel Baldwin: Of course, I'll follow you.
Everything is happening fast. What should I do?
Menu Choice: Follow them
I leap from my seat and follow the doctor.
We soon stop outside the Richard III Bedroom.
They're so preoccupied, no one comments on my presence.
Butler: Here we are. Thomas Moody's room.
We all step into the room.
Butler: He's here in his bed. He didn't respond when I tried to wake him up.
The doctor walks over and takes the man's wrist.
Daniel Baldwin: No pulse.
Daniel Baldwin: He's dead.
Lady Claythorn: Dead?!!!
Lady Claythorn: How is that possible?
Daniel Baldwin: I'm not sure yet. I'll need to examine him further.
Daniel Baldwin: Best if you stepped out for this.
Daniel Baldwin: I'll return downstairs once I know more.
Butler: Please, My Lady—this way.
Lady Claythorn: Oh... Yes, of course...
The butler escorts Lady Claythorn out.
The doctor turns to face me.
Daniel Baldwin: Mr Harring, may I ask—why are you here?
Ted Harring: I was just... I thought I might...
Daniel Baldwin: Never mind. Since you're here, you can help.
Daniel Baldwin: Let's turn him over and check for injuries.
He examines the body thoroughly for some time.
Ted Harring: What do you think happened, Doctor?
Daniel Baldwin: I'm not certain.
Daniel Baldwin: He seemed in reasonable health.
Daniel Baldwin: But war injuries can be unpredictable.
Daniel Baldwin: Some patients are stable for years, then... sudden failure.
Ted Harring: So it was natural?
Daniel Baldwin: Possibly. But I can't be sure.
Daniel Baldwin: Nothing can be ruled out.
Daniel Baldwin: We'll need a post-mortem to know for certain.
Daniel Baldwin: First, I'll need to contact the authorities.
He leaves the room.
I trail behind, back to the dining room.
As we returned to the dining room, the host had just finished explaining the situation.
She regained her composure when she saw the doctor.
Lady Claythorn: Doctor Baldwin, can you tell us more about what happened?
Daniel Baldwin: I can't say anything definitive for now.
Daniel Baldwin: But it's very likely a natural death, possibly triggered by an old wound from the war.
Daniel Baldwin: In any case, we need to call the authorities.
Lady Claythorn: Yes, of course.
Lady Claythorn: My butler will take care of it.
Daniel Baldwin: Very well.
We then continue eating in sad silence.
Nobody speaks much.
When everyone is done eating, Lady Claythorn speaks up.
Lady Claythorn: Well, as I mentioned earlier, activities were planned for today.
Lady Claythorn: This morning, those who wished to were supposed to go on a hunt.
Lady Claythorn: A sad event has happened, but it's not a reason to remain idle.
Lady Claythorn: So, if no one objects, I propose that we continue according to what was planned.
A murmur of assent runs through the assembly.
Lady Claythorn: Excellent.
Lady Claythorn: Everything is ready for those who wish to join the hunt.
Lady Claythorn: I know most of you are probably not accustomed to this type of event.
Lady Claythorn: That's why our staff can lend you everything you'll need—clothes, guns—and they will also assist you throughout the event.
Lady Claythorn: Of course, you can choose to simply stay here.
Lady Claythorn: You can relax and enjoy the warmth of the house until the others return.
A hunt... A true aristocratic hunt.
Now that's something to witness.
It's not as if I'll get this opportunity often.
And I might not be the only one feeling out of place, especially if Lady Claythorn is right.
So there's no need for embarrassment.
However, I've never even held a gun in my life.
Those older men might not be of the gentry, but they likely learned to shoot during the war.
What should I do?
Menu Choice: Go on the hunt and risk to embarrass yourself, or worse
Tutorial: Wait, it looks like you've unlocked something.
Tutorial: It could be that you made a choice, an observation, or found an object.
Tutorial: Basically, something that can influence the rest of the story.
Tutorial: To help you, you can now consult the "Progress" page.
Tutorial: Let's have a look at it.
Well, I don't know if this is my best idea.
But I guess it didn't feel right to stay behind with the ladies.
Butler: So, this is your first hunt, Mr Harring?
Ted Harring: Yes. I must admit that I don't even know how to use a rifle.
Butler: Not to worry, sir. A footman will follow you and will reload the gun for you.
Butler: All you have to do is point at your target when you encounter something and pull the trigger.
Ted Harring: All right, that sounds easy enough. Will everyone have a footman as well?
Butler: It will be just you, I believe. I will be with Lady Claythorn, and the others insisted they didn't need help.
Of course. So, I'll be the weak link today. Great.
Ted Harring: I see. And what kind of animal are we hunting today?
Butler: I think we will mostly encounter wild birds. But we might also run into some rabbits or even deer.
Ted Harring: Aren't those dangerous?
Butler: Not if you don't get too close to them. And again, you won't be alone, so there's no reason to be scared.
Ted Harring: I am not scared, just curious.
Butler: Right.
Butler: Anyway, you can pick up this gun and wear the clothes I laid out on the table.
Butler: Join the others outside when you're ready.
Ted Harring: Perfect, thanks.
I try on the clothes before me. They fit perfectly.
If something happens to me, at least I'll look good.
I join the others in the garden.
They all look quite comfortable in their hunting clothes.
There's Doctor Baldwin, Sushil Sinha, Lady Claythorn and her staff.
And even Samuel Manning is here.
Wait, what?!
How on earth was he allowed to come with us?
I approach the butler.
Ted Harring: Is it okay for Mr Manning to have a gun? He seemed a bit drunk this morning.
Butler: I was concerned about that at first too. But I just spoke to him, and I can assure you he's perfectly fine.
Butler: He might have been a bit off because of yesterday, but the breakfast and the events of this morning must have sobered him up.
Ted Harring: All right, if you're sure.
Still, I'd better stay away from him.
Butler: Good, now that everyone is ready, I propose we split into two groups.
Butler: It will be easier to spot game that way.
People agree, and Sushil Sinha asks to partner with our host.
The drunk man insists on going with the doctor, who reluctantly accepts.
I am the odd one out.
Which group should I join?
Menu Choice: Lady Claythorn and Sushil Sinha
Following our hostess seemed to be the safest course of action.
The only problem is that both she and Sushil Sinha are completely in their element.
While I clearly am not.
They've already shot a few rabbits and a pheasant.
Out of pity, they even tried to help me shoot a deer that crossed my path.
However, I merely managed to scare the animal away.
Sushil Sinha: Tough luck, Mr Harring. I'm sure you'll get the next one.
Ted Harring: Thank you, but I don't think this is for me. I believe I missed it by several feet.
Sushil Sinha: Don't fret, you just lack practice.
Sushil Sinha: Then again, it might be for the best. You wouldn't have wanted to serve in the war.
Sushil Sinha: It was truly brutal. Nothing like the previous conflicts I participated in.
Ted Harring: Have you fought in many wars?
Sushil Sinha: Indeed, I began my career in India and encountered my first battle during the war with Burma.
Sushil Sinha: I was also involved in the Chinese rebellion. Then ...
Our conversation about the wars seemed to make Lady Claythorn uneasy, as she suddenly interrupts us.
Lady Claythorn: Well, I believe it's time for luncheon. How would you feel about settling here for our picnic?
Sushil Sinha: Yes, it's a perfect spot.
We began setting up the picnic.
However, before we could start eating, we heard a gunshot nearby.
Sushil Sinha: Ah, it sounds like the others have caught something. And they're not far from here.
But soon after the gunshot, another sound followed.
A desperate cry for help.
The captain and I heard it, immediately jumping to our feet.
We rushed in the direction of the cry.
Soon, we came upon the others.
Doctor Baldwin is on the ground.
Standing beside him is Samuel Manning, visibly shaken.
Samuel Manning: Oh my God, oh my God.
Samuel Manning: It was an accident.
Samuel Manning: I can't believe this happened.
Captain Sinha grabbed him.
Sushil Sinha: What have you done, fool?
Samuel Manning: I shot at a rabbit, but missed.
Samuel Manning: I didn't mean to hit him.
Samuel Manning: I didn't...
We look down at Daniel Baldwin.
Next to him are empty vials and a syringe.
Footman: He asked me to give him that.
Footman: Then he nodded off right after.
Captain Sinha sits next to the victim to check his pulse.
Sushil Sinha: It is too late.
Sushil Sinha: His heart has stopped.
Sushil Sinha: He is dead.
Everything happened so quickly; it's all a blur.
After the screaming and crying in the woods, Captain Sinha took charge.
He had us carry the doctor on a makeshift stretcher.
It took a while, but we eventually reached the mansion.
Amelia Baxter: Oh my God! What happened!?
Amelia Baxter: Is that Doctor Baldwin? Is he injured?
Amelia Baxter: Oh no! Is he... dead?
Sushil Sinha: I'm sorry, dear, but he is.
Amelia Baxter: But... what happened?
Sushil Sinha: It was an accident.
Samuel Manning: I swear it was! I have no idea how I could have hit him.
Samuel Manning: I was aiming at a rabbit. I didn't even see him.
Everyone turns to him.
Amelia Baxter: You fool! You were probably too drunk, and that's why you hit him.
Amelia Baxter: You could barely walk this morning. Who gave you a gun?
Sushil Sinha: Please, there's no need to point fingers now. It's done.
Sushil Sinha: The police will handle it.
Sushil Sinha: Speaking of which, has anyone from the city arrived yet?
Amelia Baxter: No, not yet.
Amelia Baxter: We're still waiting for them.
Sushil Sinha: We should tell them to hurry.
Sushil Sinha: Lady Claythorn, where's the phone?
Lady Claythorn: I'll handle it.
She leaves the group, with the butler following closely behind.
The room falls silent.
Most eyes are on Sam Manning, filled with disdain.
Then, the hostess returns.
Lady Claythorn: I just spoke with the police. They aren't coming today.
Sushil Sinha: What!? Why not?
Lady Claythorn: They were on their way but encountered a huge tree blocking the road.
Lady Claythorn: They couldn't get past it.
Lady Claythorn: They said they'll be back tomorrow with assistance.
Amelia Baxter: But... what are we going to do with him until then?
Sushil Sinha: We'll move him to his bed for now.
Sushil Sinha: It's the best we can do under the circumstances.
Sushil Sinha: Anyone willing to help?
Ted Harring: I will.
We carried Doctor Baldwin to his room and laid him on his bed.
Sushil then covered him with a blanket.
Sushil Sinha: It's the best we can do at the moment.
Sushil Sinha: We shouldn't linger here.
Sushil Sinha: I want to keep an eye on Samuel Manning.
Ted Harring: Of course.
Sushil Sinha: Also Mr Harring, you might want to change before rejoining us.
I glance at my clothes.
They're stained with blood.
He is right, I can't go back downstairs looking like this.
So, I retreated to my room to fetch clean clothes.
I also took the opportunity to have a bath.
As I was preparing to go downstairs again, someone knocked on my door.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, may I come in?
Amelia Baxter... What does she want?
Ted Harring: Come on in, Mrs. Baxter. The door is open.
Amelia Baxter: I'm sorry to intrude, but I believe we should talk.
She doesn't wait for an answer and begins explaining.
Amelia Baxter: Something dangerous is happening here.
Ted Harring: What do you mean?
Amelia Baxter: Don't you find it strange that two different people died in the same place, from two different causes?
Ted Harring: Well, I don't know about Thomas Moody.
Ted Harring: But for the doctor's death, you said it yourself: Samuel Manning was probably drunk.
Ted Harring: That's tragic, but not really surprising.
Amelia Baxter: That's what I initially thought.
Amelia Baxter: However, I just spoke with the butler. He insisted that Samuel Manning was clear-minded when he handed him his gun.
Ted Harring: So, what, you think he staged the accident?
Ted Harring: He might've just drank too much during the hunt.
Amelia Baxter: Possibly, but it's still suspicious.
Amelia Baxter: I have other reasons to believe something is amiss here.
Amelia Baxter: Let's just say, I have a feeling.
Ted Harring: You can "feel" it?
Amelia Baxter: Don't dismiss what you don't understand, Mr Harring.
Amelia Baxter: But it's okay. I don't need you to believe me.
Amelia Baxter: I'm simply warning you to be cautious.
Ted Harring: Are you scared of Samuel Manning?
Amelia Baxter: Yes, but not just him.
Amelia Baxter: Others might be involved too.
Amelia Baxter: I don't think we can trust anyone fully.
Ted Harring: Yet, you seem to trust me.
Amelia Baxter: Well, I wouldn't put it that way.
Amelia Baxter: If someone were after me, I'd be defenseless. So, I need an ally.
Amelia Baxter: You seem capable of defending both of us if there's a direct confrontation.
Amelia Baxter: So, I chose to confide in you.
I'm at a loss for words.
A murder?
She is probably paranoid.
But still...
The gong sounds.
Everything that happened didn't disturbed the order of the house, it seems.
Amelia Baxter: It is dinner time.
Amelia Baxter: Not that I'm particularly hungry.
Amelia Baxter: But we should head downstairs regardless.
I nod in agreement.
Amelia Baxter: I believe we should continue this conversation later.
Amelia Baxter: If you agree, come see me in my room after dinner.
Amelia Baxter: I'm in the "Elizabeth I" room.
As I enter the room, the atmosphere is gloomy.
The seats of Daniel Baldwin and Thomas Moody are empty.
Samuel Manning is also absent.
I take my usual seat, with only Amelia Baxter beside me now.
Lady Claythorn starts a speech.
Lady Claythorn: Now that everyone is here, I want to express my deepest regret for what happened today.
Lady Claythorn: This isn't how I imagined our weekend.
Lady Claythorn: I don't believe any of us are in the mood for more entertainment.
Lady Claythorn: So, tomorrow morning, you'll receive your rewards.
Lady Claythorn: Afterward, we'll wait for the police to arrive.
Lady Claythorn: You're free to head home as soon as the officers give the all-clear.
Lady Claythorn: For now, enjoy your dinner.
Lady Claythorn: Drinks will be available in the billiard room afterwards, as they were yesterday.
The food is served shortly after the speech.
Yet, most of us have little appetite.
Ted Harring: Miss Baxter, I don't see Samuel Manning.
Ted Harring: Do you know where he might be?
Amelia Baxter: He's locked in his room.
Amelia Baxter: After you left, there was a debate about how to handle him.
Amelia Baxter: Ultimately, we decided it best to confine him to his room.
Amelia Baxter: He didn't resist.
Amelia Baxter: That's where he is now.
Amelia Baxter: It was agreed that his dinner would be served there.
Well, that's one less thing to worry about.
No one seems up for small talk.
Dinner passes in silence.
Most guests retire to their rooms after eating.
Given the day's events, I doubt many are in the mood for drinks.
What should I do next?
Map Choice: Check if there is someone in the Billiard Room
Just as I expected, there aren't many people here.
I can only spot Captain Sinha sitting on a couch and the butler in the corner.
At least the bar is still there.
Menu Choice: Leave the room
Map Choice: Richard III Bedroom
The poor man is still there. I don't think he's moved.
Now that I'm here, perhaps I should take a quick look.
There might be something that helps me understand what happened.
I look around the room.
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
He looks peaceful.
His mask is still on.
The doctor didn't even remove it for the examination.
Well, if the doctor didn't, I certainly won't either.
On a chair next to the bed, his clothes are meticulously folded.
There's a whisky flask on the nightstand.
It's on its side, empty.
Next to it is a stain.
I suppose it's whisky, but it's an odd shade of green.
That's peculiar.
What could it be?
That's all I notice in the room.
Map Choice: Library
It's a very nice library. But what am I doing here?
I can barely read.
There is an open book on a small table.
"A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain."
Yeah, I'm not reading that.
I should probably look elsewhere.
Map Choice: Have a talk with Amelia Baxter
Ted Harring: Miss Baxter?
Ted Harring: Are you here? It's Ted Harring.
She slightly opens the door and looks in the hallway.
She seems worried.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, are you alone?
Ted Harring: I am.
Amelia Baxter: Come on in then.
Amelia Baxter: So, have you given any thought to what I told you?
Amelia Baxter: Do you agree that something isn't right?
Menu Choice: Admit she might be right
Ted Harring: I'm not sure yet. But what happened is strange enough that we should take some precautions.
Amelia Baxter: I'm glad you agree.
Amelia Baxter: I've given this a lot of thought, and I believe if what I fear is true, Samuel Manning had help from someone else.
Ted Harring: Do you mean a guest? Or could someone from the staff be involved?
Amelia Baxter: I wouldn't rule anything out, but it seems less likely that the staff or Lady Claythorn would be implicated.
Amelia Baxter: Such an act would require a massive operation.
Amelia Baxter: No, a more plausible theory is that one or two individuals heard about the event and took the places of real guests to infiltrate the manor.
Ted Harring: But why would they do that?
Amelia Baxter: Well, it's rather obvious, isn't it?
Amelia Baxter: The prize money, of course.
Amelia Baxter: It was mentioned in the invitation letter that the prize will be given in bearer's bonds.
Ted Harring: Bearer's bonds?
Amelia Baxter: That's a note that you can exchange at the bank without having to prove your identity.
Amelia Baxter: So, it's almost as easy to use as cash.
Ted Harring: That's a lot of money hidden somewhere in the manor.
Ted Harring: So you think it could be a mere robbery?
Ted Harring: Why not just directly attack the manor?
Amelia Baxter: It's easier to enter incognito.
Amelia Baxter: First, observe and then discreetly eliminate potential threats.
Amelia Baxter: That's the most likely explanation I could think of.
Ted Harring: I suppose that's possible.
Ted Harring: But there's no way to determine who might be involved.
Amelia Baxter: Exactly.
Amelia Baxter: That's why I suggest we stay safely in our rooms tonight.
Amelia Baxter: Tomorrow morning, the first one of us to wake up should alert the other.
Amelia Baxter: Then we stick together the entire day until we can safely leave.
Amelia Baxter: What do you think?
Ted Harring: It sounds like a good plan.
Ted Harring: Let's do it.
Amelia Baxter: Great!
Amelia Baxter: Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
Menu Choice: What do you think of this weather?
Amelia Baxter: I must say that last night was quite scary.
Amelia Baxter: It has been a while since I've experienced a storm like that.
Amelia Baxter: We should consider ourselves lucky if there is no damage to the manor.
Menu Choice: Tell me more about yourself.
Amelia Baxter: Oh, where to begin? I suppose I'm just an old woman who keeps herself busy.
Amelia Baxter: I tend to my garden and brew herbal remedies,
Amelia Baxter: and I usually keep to myself, except for the séances that I frequently organise.
Ted Harring: Séances? You mean like talking to the dead?
Amelia Baxter: Well, simply put, yes. But there's more to it than that, of course.
Ted Harring: I've never been to one of those... séances. How does that work?
Amelia Baxter: There isn't just one way of doing it.
Amelia Baxter: Personally, I usually ask people to bring items that belonged to their loved ones who have passed.
Amelia Baxter: Through these objects, I am able to form a bond with the soul of the deceased.
Amelia Baxter: Then, they communicate with me. Sometimes it's just a whisper, barely audible.
Amelia Baxter: Other times, I can see them clearly, just as I see you now.
Amelia Baxter: And on rare occasions, they can take over my body and speak directly to their loved ones through me.
Ted Harring: You mean... like being possessed?
Amelia Baxter: Yes, but don't worry, there's nothing unholy about it.
Amelia Baxter: It only lasts for a few moments, and I always regain full control immediately after.
Still... that doesn't make me feel at ease.
Menu Choice: Why were you invited here?
Amelia Baxter: I was invited here because of something I did a couple of years ago.
Amelia Baxter: You might actually remember the event. It was in all the papers at the time.
Amelia Baxter: You see, with my talent, I am sometimes able to help people who desperately need it.
Amelia Baxter: One day, a young couple came to see me.
Amelia Baxter: Their only son, not even five years old, had been kidnapped.
Amelia Baxter: The police had no clues about what might have happened.
Amelia Baxter: Desperate, they sought my help.
Amelia Baxter: Right away, I could tell the child was still alive but in great danger.
Amelia Baxter: I saw him with a specific individual whom I described to the couple.
Amelia Baxter: They were able to identify her immediately.
Amelia Baxter: She was an old family friend who often visited their house.
Amelia Baxter: Nobody had suspected her until that point.
Amelia Baxter: But it turned out I was right. The child was indeed with her.
Amelia Baxter: She was arrested and the boy was safely returned to his parents.
Amelia Baxter: Since they were prestigious members of the nobility, a duke and duchess, the story was prominent in the press.
Amelia Baxter: My popularity grew quite a lot after that.
Ted Harring: Wait, I don't understand.
Ted Harring: How did you know the child was in danger?
Ted Harring: You can also communicate with people who are still alive?
Amelia Baxter: In a sense yes.
Amelia Baxter: Like I said, there is more to my gift that just talking with the dead.
Amelia Baxter: I can also sense if someone life is at risk.
Amelia Baxter: Some say it is because when someone is close to the other world, we can sense them almost like they are already there.
Amelia Baxter: But for myself, I think it's something else entirely.
Amelia Baxter: I believe I can only talk to the dead.
Amelia Baxter: So when I can sense someone who is still alive. It means to me that there is a version of them that is not.
Amelia Baxter: I am not sure if you understand what I mean.
Ted Harring: I don't know.
Ted Harring: You mean someone can be dead and alive at the same time?
Amelia Baxter: Yes. I believe some version of the person died in an other realm of existence.
Amelia Baxter: Then they came back to help a version of them who is still alive.
Amelia Baxter: I am sorry. That must sound like nonsense to you.
Amelia Baxter: Forget I said anything. I get carried away sometimes.
Amelia Baxter: But tell me. Why were you invited yourself?
So I tell her my story.
Amelia Baxter: Oh how interesting! I assumed most people were here because of something they did during the war.
Ted Harring: It would have been difficult for me. I was but sixteen when the war ended.
Amelia Baxter: Really? I thought you were older.
Ted Harring: I think I should keep looking around the manor. I might learn something useful.
Amelia Baxter: It's not a bad idea. I will stay here tonight if you don't mind.
Amelia Baxter: Good luck.
Ted Harring: Thanks.
Wandering through this house has taken its toll.
And with everything that happened today, I'm drained.
I should go back to my room.
Before trying to sleep, it seems a good idea to barricade the door with some furniture.
You can't be too cautious.
That should be enough.
Now, I can rest peacefully.
I am awaken by the sound of frantic knocking at the door.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, are you there?
Miss Baxter?
Right, we agreed to wake each other up.
I just didn't expect it to be this early.
Ted Harring: I'm coming!
I quickly get dressed and open the door.
Amelia Baxter enters, looking visibly nervous.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Haring, I believe my hunch was right yesterday.
Amelia Baxter: Something strange is afoot.
Ted Harring: What do you mean?
Amelia Baxter: I haven't seen any staff members on my way here.
Amelia Baxter: At this hour, they should be busy with lighting fires, cleaning and setting up breakfast.
Amelia Baxter: Yet, I neither saw nor heard anyone.
Amelia Baxter: It's as silent as a graveyard in here.
Ted Harring: Are you sure it's not just because it's so early?
Amelia Baxter: I'm certain.
Amelia Baxter: I was up at the same time yesterday, and the house was bustling with activity.
Amelia Baxter: Something's not right, I assure you.
Ted Harring: Okay, if you say so.
Ted Harring: But how is that related to a robbery?
Amelia Baxter: I'm not so sure anymore that this is about a robbery.
Amelia Baxter: I have a feeling it could be something much worse.
A chill goes through my body.
Worse than a robbery? What could she mean?
But I'm hesitant to ask her.
Instead, I try to appear confident.
Ted Harring: Alright, we'd better investigate then.
Map Choice: Library
We enter the small library and find it empty.
There's no room for anyone to hide here.
Let's move on.
Map Choice: Garage
I take the stairs to the basement, expecting to be stopped at any moment.
But no one is there.
I can safely explore downstairs now.
The garage.
This is where Lady Claythorn's car should be.
But instead, there are only parts of other cars and an old model in a shabby state.
Ted Harring: Did you come here in this car?
Amelia Baxter: No, of course not.
Amelia Baxter: Lady Claythorn's chauffeur drove us here in a Rolls Royce.
Amelia Baxter: Not in this old thing.
Ted Harring: Me neither.
Ted Harring: But if everyone has left, we might need it to reach the next town.
Amelia Baxter: Right. But do you know how to drive it?
Amelia Baxter: Because I surely can't.
Ted Harring: Not really, no.
Ted Harring: I never learned how to drive.
It's not like I could afford a car anyway.
Map Choice: Dining Room
Ted Harring: Nobody seems to be here.
Amelia Baxter: And the table isn't set for breakfast either.
Amelia Baxter: That's unusual.
Map Choice: Billiard room
The billiard room is empty.
But the drinks remain untouched.
Perhaps I should have a drink to calm my nerves.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, you aren't considering drinking at this hour, are you?
Ted Harring: Uh, no, of course not.
That's probably wiser.
Let's explore further.
Map Choice: Richard III Bedroom
I'm in Thomas Moody's room.
He is still lying on the bed.
I see no one else around.
I should move on.
Map Choice: Scullery
Ted Harring: Do you know what room this is?
Amelia Baxter: The scullery.
Wait, what the hell is a scullery?
Miss Baxter must have noticed my puzzled look, because she went on explaining.
Amelia Baxter: It's primarily where they wash dishes.
Amelia Baxter: If you look in the sink, there are a lot of dirty dishes.
Amelia Baxter: It seems nobody cleaned up after supper yesterday.
Right.
It's empty anyway, no need to linger here.
Map Choice: Gun room
The gun room is a bit intimidating.
So much firepower for just one household.
It makes me uneasy.
Ted Harring: Nobody is here.
Amelia Baxter: No, indeed.
Amelia Baxter: But don't you think it might be useful to get a weapon for protection?
Well, I don't have much experience with guns.
It might be a bad idea.
But then again, I don't know what we might encounter today.
Menu Choice: Take the gun. It doesn't matter that I don't know how to use it
Ted Harring: You are right.
Ted Harring: We should get something to defend ourselves.
The hunting rifles are a bit too large.
But I spot a revolver that fits my pocket.
Ted Harring: Alright, I'll take this with me.
Ted Harring: However, there are no bullets in it.
Amelia Baxter: Sometimes, bullets are kept separate from the guns.
Amelia Baxter: It reduces the likelihood of accidents.
Ted Harring: So, where could they be?
Amelia Baxter: I have no idea.
Amelia Baxter: Will you still take it?
Ted Harring: I think so, even an empty gun can still scare someone away.
Amelia Baxter: I suppose.
She doesn't look very convinced.
I pocket the gun anyway.
Map Choice: Tea room
Here I am, back in the first room I visited in the manor.
All the liveliness of that first day is gone.
Now, it stands silent and empty.
Amelia Baxter: There's no one in here.
Amelia Baxter: Let's look elsewhere.
Ted Harring: Right, of course.
Map Choice: Entrance Hall
The entrance hall is usually the heart of the house.
But there's no activity today.
Just in case, I try to call out for someone.
Ted Harring: Is anyone here?
I didn't really expect an answer.
But an authoritative voice echoes from up the stairs.
Sushil Sinha: Who goes there?
Ted Harring: It's Ted Harring. I'm down here, and Amelia Baxter's with me.
Sushil Sinha: Understood. I'm on my way down.
Soon enough, Captain Sinha comes into view, descending the staircase to join us on the ground floor.
Sushil Sinha: At last, living, breathing souls.
Sushil Sinha: I was starting to feel like I was in a ghost house.
Amelia Baxter: We feel the same. You're the first person we've encountered today as well.
Ted Harring: Do you have any idea what's going on?
Sushil Sinha: Nothing concrete. All I know is, I don't like it.
Sushil Sinha: People don't just vanish from their homes without reason.
Amelia Baxter: They certainly don't.
Sushil Sinha: And then there's the matter of the suspicious deaths.
Sushil Sinha: I could've dismissed them as bad luck yesterday, but now... I'm not so certain.
The conversation lingers in the air, a heavy silence stretching between us.
Amelia Baxter: Staying put won't give us any answers.
Amelia Baxter: We need to continue exploring the house.
Sushil Sinha: Agreed. Should we search together?
Amelia Baxter: Thank you, but... maybe it's better to split up.
Amelia Baxter: We'd cover more ground that way.
Amelia seemed nervous when she answered.
Sushil Sinha: Makes sense. Let's proceed on our own and regroup later.
Sushil Sinha: How about the tea room?
Amelia Baxter: That sounds good.
Amelia Baxter: See you there.
Map Choice: Portrait Gallery
The creepy portrait gallery.
The paintings seem to be looking at me.
But besides them, no one in here.
Map Choice: Edward II Bedroom
I'm back in Daniel Baldwin's room.
His lifeless body still lies on the bed.
Aside from that, everything seems in order.
I don't wish to linger here any longer than necessary.
Map Choice: Female Servants Room
I took the stairs to the attic.
I'm not sure if I should be here.
I try to open the room, but it's closed.
Map Choice: Garden
We venture out to explore the garden.
But there's no trace of anyone.
Lady Claythorn's car isn't there either.
I try shouting to attract attention.
Ted Harring: Hello! Is anyone here?
Ted Harring: Hello!!
No response.
Amelia Baxter: I don't think shouting will help.
Amelia Baxter: If someone's here, we'll find them.
Oh, was shouting inappropriate?
I guess she'll always prioritize decorum, no matter the situation.
Let's head back inside then.
Map Choice: George I Bedroom
Ted Harring: I knock on the door.
Ted Harring: There's no response.
Before I can say anything, Amelia is already trying the handle.
Amelia Baxter: It's locked.
Amelia Baxter: I believe this is Captain Sinha's room.
Ted Harring: He doesn't seem to be here.
Amelia Baxter: We should continue our search elsewhere.
I doubt we'll find anyone now.
So we settled in the tea room to wait for Captain Sinha.
Sushil Sinha: It's unbelievable, but it seems we're the only three living souls left here.
Sushil Sinha: Did you find anything?
Ted Harring: Nothing.
Ted Harring: It seems everyone is gone.
Ted Harring: Except for the bodies.
Ted Harring: By the way, did you check on Samuel Manning?
Ted Harring: You're the only one with the key to his room.
Sushil Sinha: No, not yet. I assumed he couldn't have gone far.
Sushil Sinha: But you're right, we should check on him.
Ted Harring: I think so too.
Ted Harring: We'll follow you.
Amelia shoots me a concerned look but remains silent.
She follows us nonetheless.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Manning, are you there?
No response.
Sushil Sinha: Alright, I'm going in.
He unlocks the door, and we trail behind him.
But as I step inside, Captain Sinha tries to halt us.
Sushil Sinha: Wait! Don't come in.
But it's already too late.
The sight inside is beyond horrifying.
Samuel Manning lies in his bed, drenched in blood, his throat slashed multiple times.
Pale as a sheet, his eyes frozen in a blank stare.
Miss Baxter almost screams.
Sushil Sinha: Miss Baxter, please don't stay here.
She's speechless, her gaze fixed on the horrifying scene.
Sushil Sinha gently pulls her arm, leading her out. I quickly follow.
Sushil Sinha: I regret letting you see that.
Sushil Sinha: You shouldn't have entered.
Amelia Baxter: Is... is he... dead?
Sushil Sinha: I'm afraid so.
Ted Harring: Are you certain?
Ted Harring: Shouldn't we check his pulse?
Ted Harring: Maybe... just maybe, there's a chance he's alive.
My voice trembles as I speak, realisation dawning on me.
Sushil Sinha: I'm sorry, but it's too late.
Sushil Sinha: I've seen enough dead people to know. He's been gone for a long time.
Sushil Sinha: Likely since last night.
Amelia Baxter: Oh my God.
The weight of shock renders me motionless.
To help us recover, Sushil guides us back to the tea room.
Sushil Sinha: Miss Baxter, you should probably rest here for a little bit.
Sushil Sinha: I have something to check out, and I'll be back soon.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Harring, would you mind coming with me?
I'm still shaken from what we saw, but doing something might help me recover my senses.
Ted Harring: Well, sure.
Ted Harring: I'll follow you.
Amelia Baxter: Please don't be long.
Sushil Sinha: Don't worry, this should only take a few minutes.
He walks back up the stairs and stands in front of another room.
Sushil Sinha: It's Miss Marsh's room.
Sushil Sinha: When I tried the handle earlier it was locked.
Sushil Sinha: At the time, I didn't dare to go further.
Sushil Sinha: But now, I fear we may have no choice.
Ted Harring: Do you believe she might still be inside?
Ted Harring: Then she would be...
Sushil Sinha: Dead, I am afraid.
Sushil Sinha: After what we witnessed, I think it a very strong possibility.
Ted Harring: Oh my God.
Sushil Sinha: There is no need to break the door.
Sushil Sinha: The butler entrusted me with a master key when we confined Mr Manning.
Sushil Sinha: It should open every room in the house.
He has a master key?
That mean he is able to visit every room of this place.
Captain Sinha then slips a small key from his pocket.
With a steady hand he turns the lock.
The mechanism clicks, and the door swings open into the silence beyond.
The room is eerily quiet.
But Rosalind Marsh is not there.
We look in every corner, but we can't find anything of interest.
Ted Harring: What a relief.
Sushil Sinha: Yes, of course. But there's no need to linger here.
Sushil Sinha: Let's return to the tea room, we need to talk with Miss Baxter to decide our next steps.
Amelia Baxter: You've been gone for a while. What happened?
Sushil Sinha: I'm afraid we haven't been able to find Miss Marsh.
Sushil Sinha: Her room was locked, so we forced it open.
Sushil Sinha: But it was all for naught, as it was empty.
Amelia Baxter: Well, what should we do now?
Sushil Sinha: You both seem a bit shaken up.
Sushil Sinha: That's not surprising, given what you've witnessed.
Sushil Sinha: It's easier for me.
Sushil Sinha: Sadly, I've seen my share of dead people.
Sushil Sinha: So I suggest you two rest for a bit while I continue to explore the manor.
Sushil Sinha: I'll be back soon.
I feel like I should accompany him.
But he is right, I am exhausted and overwhelmed.
So I just agree with a nod and sit down.
We stayed in the tea room and gathered our strength while Sushil Sinha kept searching the manor.
When he returned, we had started to feel a bit better.
Sushil Sinha: I believe I've looked absolutely everywhere now.
Sushil Sinha: There is no trace of anyone.
Sushil Sinha: I also tried to use the telephone, and it's not working.
Sushil Sinha: Thus, there is no way for us to call for help.
Sushil Sinha: The way I see it now, we don't have many options left.
Sushil Sinha: I believe we must leave this place.
Sushil Sinha: The longer we stay, the more at risk we are.
Amelia Baxter: But... shouldn't we wait for the police?
Amelia Baxter: They were expected today. They could arrive any moment.
Sushil Sinha: I wouldn't count on it.
Sushil Sinha: From what I gather, there's no evidence that the police were called yesterday.
Amelia Baxter: But Miss Claythorn said...
Amelia Baxter: She said...
She stops mid-sentence, realising the implication.
Amelia Baxter: I see, you believe she never called.
Amelia Baxter: That the police have no idea about what's happened here.
Amelia Baxter: That she lied to us.
Sushil Sinha: That's the most logical explanation.
Sushil Sinha: No one was around when the phone calls were supposedly made.
Sushil Sinha: So, there's no way to verify if they actually happened.
Ted Harring: But why?
Ted Harring: Why would anyone do this?
Ted Harring: I don't understand what's happening.
Sushil Sinha: Neither do I.
Sushil Sinha: I've thought about it, and I have no clue why we were all invited here.
Sushil Sinha: I'm certain it wasn't to give us any money.
Sushil Sinha: In any case, all I know is we need to leave as soon as possible.
Amelia Baxter: But how could we leave?
Amelia Baxter: The nearest town is miles away.
Amelia Baxter: I can't walk that far.
Amelia Baxter: And even if I could, I'm not prepared for such a journey.
Captain Sinha and I consider this for a moment.
Sushil Sinha: You might be right.
Sushil Sinha: It would be a long walk, and the weather might turn at any moment.
Sushil Sinha: We could get caught in another storm.
Sushil Sinha: It's probably unsafe for you to join us.
Amelia Baxter: But you're not going to leave me here alone, are you?
Amelia Baxter: What would become of me?
Sushil Sinha: We could lock you in a room.
Sushil Sinha: Though, that's far from ideal.
Sushil Sinha: Perhaps one of us should stay with you.
Amelia Baxter: Yes!
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring can stay with me, right?
Amelia Baxter: The two of us should be safe until you return with help.
Sushil Sinha: That seems to be the wisest choice.
Sushil Sinha: What do you think, Mr Harring?
Menu Choice: Stay here with Amelia Baxter
I don't feel comfortable leaving Amelia Baxter alone here.
And in any case, I don't like the idea of being alone with this guy in the forest.
For all we know, he might very well be the killer.
Miss Baxter doesn't seem to trust him either.
So I figure it's best for us to stay here and be on our guard.
If we're lucky, the captain will return with reinforcements, and everything will be fine.
Ted Harring: I think I should stay here.
Amelia Baxter: Yes! Thank you, Mr Harring.
Sushil Sinha: It's decided then, I'll go alone.
Sushil Sinha: And there is no time to lose, so I better leave immediately.
Amelia Baxter: Good thinking. And don't worry about us, we'll be fine here.
Amelia Baxter: Be careful.
Ted Harring: Good luck, Captain.
Sushil Sinha: Thank you both. I will be back soon.
We watched him leave the room, and I can sense relief in Miss Baxter's eyes.
As soon as Captain Sinha is out of sight, she stands up.
Amelia Baxter: Well, there's no point in waiting around doing nothing.
Amelia Baxter: We haven't eaten since yesterday.
Amelia Baxter: I could check the kitchen to see if there's anything I can prepare.
Ted Harring: Okay, I'll come with you.
We were heading to the lower floor when we heard a shout.
Rosalind Marsh: Hello!
Rosalind Marsh: Is there someone here?
Amelia Baxter: Oh my God, Miss Marsh, you're here!
Rosalind Marsh: Of course I am here. Why do you look so surprised?
Rosalind Marsh: I'm afraid I overslept. I don't feel quite like myself today.
Rosalind Marsh: When I woke up, I went to check the dining room but found it empty.
Rosalind Marsh: I wandered in the house for a while but I didn't see anyone until I met you.
Rosalind Marsh: Where is everybody?
Amelia Baxter: Oh my dear, we don't know.
We updated her on what happened since this morning.
When we had finished telling her the story, she remained relatively calm, considering the situation.
Rosalind Marsh: Poor Mr Manning, what a terrible fate.
Rosalind Marsh: And what horror that must have been for you, my dear.
Rosalind Marsh: Are you all right?
Amelia Baxter: I am better now.
Amelia Baxter: Captain Sinha should be back with help soon, so I'll be fine if I can keep my mind occupied until then.
Amelia Baxter: Speaking of which, we were heading to the kitchen to see if we can prepare some sort of meal.
Rosalind Marsh: Right, it's a good idea. We might as well keep ourselves busy.
And just like that, we headed downstairs to the kitchen.
We look around for something to eat.
Amelia Baxter: There isn't much.
Amelia Baxter: But I think we can manage a light luncheon if you're not picky.
Rosalind Marsh: I'll help you.
I offer to help as well, but they decline.
So, I take a seat while they prepare the food.
That's probably for the best.
I couldn't do much to help anyway.
When everything is ready, I carry the plates to the dining room.
I set them at our usual places.
Then I leave the dining room.
Amelia Baxter: Where are you going, Mr Harring?
Amelia Baxter: It's better if we stick together at all times.
Ted Harring: I understand, but there's something I need to do alone.
Ted Harring: We haven't had a moment apart the entire day and...
Amelia Baxter: Say no more, I understand.
Amelia Baxter: I'm in the same situation.
Amelia Baxter: What about you, Miss Marsh?
Rosalind Marsh: Oh, I'm fine, thank you.
Rosalind Marsh: You both go, I'll finish preparing the table.
Amelia Baxter: Very well.
Amelia Baxter: Let's meet back here in a few minutes then.
Ted Harring: Of course.
I accompany Miss Baxter to her room.
Amelia Baxter: This is where we part.
Amelia Baxter: We'll meet again in the dining room in a few minutes.
Ted Harring: Alright, see you soon.
After seeing her enter her room, I head to mine.
As I walk down the hallway, I constantly look around.
It feels like someone might jump out at me any moment.
Once I reached my room, I try not to waste any time.
First things first, I spend a penny.
Once I'm done, I rush back as quickly as possible, nearly running down the stairs.
Rosalind Marsh is already at her place.
I sat down at my seat.
When Miss Baxter comes back, we start eating in silence.
There's not much we want to discuss.
After finishing my meal, I offer to help her with the dishes.
Not that it really matters now.
It's just something to do while we wait.
But as soon as I stand up, I realize I can't stay on my feet.
My head spins, and I feel faint.
Ted Harring: What's happening?
Ted Harring: Why am I...
I try to speak further, but no words come out.
I collapse to the ground.
You lay on the floor, saliva dripping from your mouth.
Whatever poison you ingested is now coursing through your veins.
Let this be a lesson to you.
Never trust anyone.
Don't worry, you'll have more chances to change the fate of this character.
You can start again now. Ideally, you've learned something that will help you in your next attempts.
But perhaps you haven't learned anything.
In that case, try to look at the story from a different perspective.
This story isn't about just one hero.
You'll get to play as different characters.
And you must.
Because otherwise, you'll never uncover the whole truth about what happened that weekend at Claythorn Manor.

As I approach my destination, I read the letter that has brought me on this trip for the tenth time.
Letter: 5th September, 1924
Letter: Dear Mr Harring,
Letter: I am pleased to announce that you have been selected as one of the recipients of the "Exceptional Act of Bravery Award".
Letter: You'll be receiving the prize, along with six other courageous individuals, at a reception organised in your honour.
Letter: As a thank you, a weekend of leisure at Claythorn Manor has been planned for all of you to enjoy.
Letter: After which, a prize money of one thousand pounds in bearer's bond will be handed to you.
Letter: Please note that your presence is mandatory in order to receive the prize.
Letter: All you have to do is be at Aberdeen Station, on the 13th of October around 4PM, where someone will drive you to the manor.
Letter: Hoping ,.....
More information follows, but that's about the content of it.
It is signed by "Lady Claythorn".
I've never heard of her.
I couldn't really believe it at first.
I don't think I am that deserving. At least no more than hundreds of other guys in this country.
But no matter the reason, I can't possibly say no to this amount of money.
So I feel as if I do not have much choice.
But still, there is part of me thinking,
Maybe I never should have come.
As I step off the train, a man approaches me.
Footman: Welcome sir. Are you by any chance, heading to Claythorn Manor?
Ted Harring: Yes, as a matter of fact I am.
As proof, I hand him the letter that I still have in my hand.
Footman: Very well Sir. Let me assist you with your luggage and you can follow me into the car.
And just like that, we are on our way.
Ted Harring: So you are lady Claythorn's driver?
Footman: Yes, I mean,.. no.
Footman: I am actually her footman. I also drive people when necessary.
Ted Harring: Oh. The driver must be busy because of all the people coming I guess.
Ted Harring: Do you know how many people have been invited this weekend?
Footman: Well, ... I am not sure sir. Half a dozen at least I believe.
Footman: But I am sorry, I must concentrate on the road ahead. Lady Claythorn doesn't like it when I am distracted.
Ted Harring: Of course, I am sorry.
Footman: No need for apologies Sir.
I seem to have made him uneasy. Maybe he's not used to small talk with guests.
This feels odd, as I'm usually on the other end of this treatment.
I wonder how well I'll blend in with the other folks at the manor.
They might be used to this kind of service.
But then again, maybe not. Maybe Lady Claythorn likes helping people like me.
We'll see.
After we leave Aberdeen, we move into the countryside, then into what seems like a vast forest.
About twenty minutes later, all signs of human life disappear.
It's nothing but dense woodland as far as the eye can see.
The isolation makes me feel a bit uneasy, being so far from everywhere else.
And the look of an approaching storm in the sky only adds to my discomfort.
Eventually, an imposing mansion emerges on the horizon.
It's bigger than any house I've ever been in.
A big country house.
Everyone who was anyone in England used to have one.
Now I've heard a lot of people can't afford them anymore.
They are sold, turned into hotels, or even abandoned. Left there to rot.
What a shame.
As the driver unloads my luggage from the car, I approach the entrance, where a butler opens the door to welcome me.
I step into the most remarkable hall I've ever set foot in.
Butler: Welcome Sir.
Ted Harring: Hello, I am Ted Harring, I have been invited by Lady Claythorn..
Butler: Yes, of course Mr Harring.
Butler: Welcome to Claythorn Manor.
Butler: I am afraid you won't have time to change right now.
Butler: Everyone is already there, and dinner will be ready very soon.
Butler: So if you follow me into the tea room, you can join the rest of the party for some drinks.
Well, it's not like I have multiple changes of clothes anyway. So, I follow him.
As I step into the room, the butler loudly introduces me.
Butler: Mr Ted Harring!
Everyone turns their head towards me.
Some people nod in my direction, while others barely acknowledge my presence.
From afar, the butler provides me with a brief introduction to each guest.
Butler: The older man talking is from India, and his name is Sushil Sinha.
Butler: He is in conversation with Rosalind Marsh...
Butler: .. and with Daniel Baldwin. The man with the glasses.
Butler: Don't be alarmed by the man in the mask.
Butler: He is a war veteran named Thomas Moody.
Butler: The man sitting on the couch, looking rather exhausted is Samuel Manning.
Butler: The older lady in the corner of the room is Amelia Baxter.
Ted Harring: I don't see our host in the room.
Butler: Lady Claythorn is still busy at the moment.
Butler: You'll meet her at dinner.
After this introduction, he leaves me and goes to stand in the corner of the room.
Most of the guests are already engaged in conversation.
However, Amelia Baxter and Samuel Manning are alone.
They seem more approachable than the rest.
Menu Choice: Talk to Samuel Manning
I am heading towards the older man.
He holds an empty glass in his hand. His gaze is empty.
Ted Harring: Hello sir, how are you?
Samuel Manning: (Snore...)
He reeks of booze, and he is deeply asleep. Talking to him is useless.
Menu Choice: Talk to Amelia Baxter
I am approaching the middle-aged woman.
Ted Harring: Nice to meet you, Miss Baxter. I am Ted Harring.
Amelia Baxter: Nice to meet you, Mr Harring.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this weather?
Amelia Baxter: Well, it is not very original to ask about such things when meeting someone new.
Amelia Baxter: But it is true that is not your average rain. It looks more like a dangerous storm to me.
Amelia Baxter: And since we are basically in the middle of nowhere, that's reason enough to be a little nervous I suppose.
What is that? A gong?
Butler: Dinner is served. Please, follow me to the dining room.
Everyone takes a seat at the spot labelled with their names.
As I observe each person, Lady Claythorn makes her entrance into the room.
She looks younger than I imagined.
I don't know why, but I pictured an elderly, bored lady. Yet she looks nothing like that.’
Her clothes, which are the most impressive of anyone's in the room, make her status clear.
She proceeds to take her seat at the table.
Lady Claythorn: Welcome, everyone. My apologies for keeping you waiting.
Lady Claythorn: Now that we're all gathered, I'd like to express my gratitude once more.
Lady Claythorn: As you already know, you are here because of the heroic acts you've committed in the past.
Lady Claythorn: I've taken notice of these actions and felt it was my responsibility to extend a formal 'thank you.'
Lady Claythorn: I realize the invitation letter you received was somewhat vague, so let me clarify its contents now.
Lady Claythorn: My first gift to you is a stay at my manor.
Lady Claythorn: You'll be fully catered to, enjoying the most refined food, expertly prepared by my personal chef.
Lady Claythorn: During the three days we'll spend together, we'll also partake in various activities, which I'm sure you'll find enjoyable.
Lady Claythorn: My second gift is a sum of one thousand pounds, to be shared among you.
Lady Claythorn: This is my way of thanking those as selfless as yourselves, who help others without thought of reward.
Following her speech, our host settles back down in her chair.
After the speech, everyone appears pleased.
A few of the guests begin to express their appreciation to the host.
Lady Claythorn: Please, there's no need to thank me.
Lady Claythorn: The food will be served shortly.
Lady Claythorn: Enjoy your meal.
At that moment, the butler enters the room, accompanied by the footman.
They begin to serve the first dish and pour drinks for everyone.
The mood in the room gradually relaxes, and the sound of various conversations fills the space.
I turn my attention to the guests seated next to me.
I find myself sitting between Amelia Baxter and Daniel Baldwin.
Menu Choice: Talk to Amelia Baxter
Ted Harring: Hi again Miss Baxter.
Amelia Baxter: Hello Mr Harring.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this place?
Amelia Baxter: Such a magnificent house right?
Amelia Baxter: Even if the style is not very recent, it still has a lot of cachet.
Amelia Baxter: You don't see a lot of that type of place anymore.
Amelia Baxter: The only problem is I don't see a lot of help for a house this big.
Amelia Baxter: And I don't think money is a problem.
Amelia Baxter: Lady Claythorn couldn't possibly give away so much money if she had enough resources.
Amelia Baxter: More likely, she couldn't find enough people to come live here.
Amelia Baxter: It has become very hard to recruit good help since the war.
Amelia Baxter: And it must be especially difficult when you are so far away from a city.
Amelia Baxter: Even in London, some of my neighbors are struggling finding employees.
Amelia Baxter: In any case, she should have a made more of an effort for this weekend.
Amelia Baxter: I hope we won't suffer any inconvenience because of this.
Okay. I would not have thought of that.
She seems in her element here.
Am I the only one in here who has never had a butler waiting on him?
Menu Choice: What do you think of the other guests?
Amelia Baxter: I've just met them. So I can't say I know a lot yet.
Amelia Baxter: All I know is that this guy over there ...
She points at Sushil Sinha.
Amelia Baxter: ... is monopolising the conversation.
Amelia Baxter: And he is very noisy too.
Amelia Baxter: It's not very tactful if you ask me.
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for her
Menu Choice: Talk to Daniel Baldwin
Ted Harring: Hello. I am Ted Harring.
Daniel Baldwin: Hi Mr Harring, I am doctor Daniel Baldwin.
Ted Harring: Nice to meet you doctor.
Menu Choice: Tell me more about yourself.
Daniel Baldwin: I am the chief physician at St. Margaret's Hospital.
Daniel Baldwin: It's a charity hospital for those in need.
Daniel Baldwin: Before that, I worked a bit all over the place.
Daniel Baldwin: I also served in the army several times, including the last one.
Daniel Baldwin: That one was the worst, of course.
Menu Choice: Why were you invited here?
Daniel Baldwin: Well, I recently celebrated my ten years at St. Margaret's.
Daniel Baldwin: Not many people stay that long at this type of institution.
Daniel Baldwin: Usually, doctors stay for a few years to build a reputation, then move on to a more luxurious practice.
Daniel Baldwin: Lady Claythorn must have understood the sacrifice I've made, hence the reward.
Daniel Baldwin: Not that I consider it a sacrifice, of course.
Daniel Baldwin: I love my job and wouldn't change it for the world.
Daniel Baldwin: Still, it's always nice to receive some recognition.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this place?
Daniel Baldwin: It's a nice house.
Daniel Baldwin: But I can't say much more about it.
Daniel Baldwin: I'm not used to visiting such places.
Daniel Baldwin: This is the first time I've been invited to a grand mansion as a guest and not as a doctor.
Daniel Baldwin: The truth is, my job doesn't pay that much.
Daniel Baldwin: Nevertheless, I'm content with my small apartment.
Daniel Baldwin: I wouldn't want anything this big; it must be such a hassle to manage.
Ted Harring: So you're not accustomed to having a butler and footmen around?
Daniel Baldwin: No, I can't say that I am.
Well, that's somewhat comforting.
The dinner comes to an end.
The host explains that we can continue our discussion and enjoy drinks in the billiard room, or, for those tired from the journey, we can simply retire for the night.
Since I haven't seen my room yet, I should probably head there first.
I ask the footman to show me the way.
The footman escorts me up the grand staircase, leading me to the first floor.
Footman: Here you are, sir.
Footman: You've been assigned the "William The Conqueror" room.
I step into the bedroom.
It's more spacious than my apartment, and more luxurious than I could have ever imagined.
Footman: I hope the room suits your taste.
Ted Harring: This is ..., this is good, yes. Thank you.
The footman exits the room.
I look around in disbelief.
After a while, I unpack my modest luggage.
It does not take long. So, what should I do now?
Map Choice: Library
It's a very nice library. But what am I doing here?
I can barely read.
There is an open book on a small table.
"A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain."
Yeah, I'm not reading that.
I should probably look elsewhere.
Map Choice: Kitchen
I was on my way to the basement when a young maid stopped me.
Young woman: Hello Sir, may I help you?
Ted Harring: Oh, don't mind me. I'm just taking a look around.
Young woman: I'm sorry, but the basement is off-limits to guests.
Young woman: However, there are plenty of rooms upstairs that you can explore.
Ted Harring: Of course, thank you.
Map Choice: Garden
I reach the great hall and prepare to open the door.
However, the weather is so bad that only a madman would venture out now.
I'd be better off doing something else at the moment.
Map Choice: Richard III Bedroom
I knock on the door.
Nobody answers.
Should I try to enter anyway?
No, that's probably a bad idea.
Map Choice: Meet the others in the billiard room
Except for Amelia Baxter, everyone from dinner is in this room.
I recognize Doctor Baldwin, sitting alone on a chair.
There's also an array of alcohol near the bar.
The remainder of the guests are clustered together, with Sushil Sinha leading the conversation.
The butler stands silently in a corner near them.
Menu Choice: Talk to Daniel Baldwin
Ted Harring: Hello Doctor.
Daniel Baldwin: Mr Harring.
Menu Choice: What room are you in?
Daniel Baldwin: I'm staying in the Edward II room.
Menu Choice: What do you think of the other guests?
Daniel Baldwin: Oh, I haven't talked to many people so far.
Daniel Baldwin: I think the only person I've heard speak is Mr Sinha.
Daniel Baldwin: And by "heard," I really just mean heard.
Daniel Baldwin: Because I don't think I was able to contribute anything to the conversation.
Menu Choice: How old are you?
Daniel Baldwin: I'm 39 years old. Why do you ask?
Ted Harring: Actually, I'm not sure.
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for him
Menu Choice: Leave the room
I don't feel like staying in this room.
Map Choice: George IV Bedroom
I knock on the door.
Nobody answers.
Should I try to enter anyway?
No, that's probably a bad idea.
It's getting quite late now.
I'm exhausted from the trip.
Going back to my room is probably the best thing to do.
It's been a long day.
So I change and get directly into bed.
Almost instantly, I fall asleep.
I slept through the night.
The storm from yesterday has passed and the weather is clearer now.
After getting ready, I leave my room to have breakfast.
Most of the guests are already seated in the dining room.
There's a breakfast buffet set up.
I serve myself a plate with eggs, bacon, bread, and a few other items, not really following any specific order.
I have no idea if this is what I'm supposed to do.
I quietly take the same seat I had yesterday, hoping to go unnoticed.
Daniel Baldwin and Amelia Baxter are already present.
Amelia Baxter: Hello, Mr Harring. How are you?
Ted Harring: Very well, thank you.
Amelia Baxter: I was wondering if everyone would join us on time.
Amelia Baxter: There are still a few people missing.
Amelia Baxter: For instance, I don't think we'll see Mr Manning anytime soon.
Amelia Baxter: He was so drunk yesterday that I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't show up before noon.
Suddenly, Samuel Manning enters the room.
He stumbles to the buffet table and picks up a plate, visibly shaking.
Amelia Baxter: Well, I spoke too soon. Here he is. And in such a state.
Amelia Baxter: How dreadful.
At the same moment, the butler rushes into the room.
He goes to Lady Claythorn and whispers something in her ear.
I can tell it's not good news.
She looks shocked and worried.
She stands up and walks in my direction, then stops in front of the doctor.
Lady Claythorn: Doctor Baldwin, I'm sorry to interrupt your breakfast, but would you mind coming with me?
Lady Claythorn: We need your assistance.
Without hesitation, Daniel Baldwin stands up.
Daniel Baldwin: Of course, I'll follow you.
Everything is happening fast. What should I do?
Menu Choice: Stay there and finish the most important meal of the day
Amelia Baxter: I wonder what this is about.
Ted Harring: Me too. I have a bad feeling about it.
Amelia Baxter: Well, there's no reason to worry now.
Amelia Baxter: We'll just have to wait and see.
Ted Harring: You're right.
Ted Harring: We should probably talk about something else.
Menu Choice: What do you think of the other guests?
Amelia Baxter: I haven't had time to form an opinion of everyone yet.
Amelia Baxter: I was just able to get to know Captain Sinha, the sorry drunk that is Samuel Manning.
Amelia Baxter: And I could also exchange a few words with our hostess, Lady Claythorn.
Menu Choice: What do you think of Samuel Manning?
Amelia Baxter: Well, I think by now you can tell as well as I that he is a dangerous drunk.
Amelia Baxter: We better stay away from him.
Menu Choice: What do you think of Sushil Sinha?
Amelia Baxter: He looks to me like the typical military man.
Amelia Baxter: Except for, you know, his origin.
Amelia Baxter: I didn't think they would accept indigenous people in the British Army.
Amelia Baxter: But beside that, he is exactly like other officers I have met.
Amelia Baxter: Bold, sure of himself, and not ashamed to talk about himself.
Amelia Baxter: I bet he will keep on telling stories about his "Glorious Days" during one war or another.
Amelia Baxter: I think it is in bad taste, so I will try to avoid him in the coming days.
Amelia Baxter: I suggest you do the same, unless you want to be bored to death.
Menu Choice: What do you think of Lady Claythorn?
Amelia Baxter: I could only exchange a few pleasantries with the Lady of the house.
Amelia Baxter: She seems delightful to me.
Amelia Baxter: What was even better, is that she addressed me as an equal.
Amelia Baxter: That's very different from most noble people I've met.
Amelia Baxter: They usually look down on people like you, ...
Amelia Baxter: ... and me.
She paused a little too long before adding "and me".
I don't like that.
Suddenly, Lady Claythorn and the butler are back in the room.
Sushil Sinha: Lady Claythorn, what is happening?
The lady is visibly distressed.
Lady Claythorn: I'm sorry to announce such horrible news, everyone.
Lady Claythorn: It appears that Mr Moody passed away in his sleep last night.
The room instantly falls silent.
Sushil Sinha: Do we know what happened?
Lady Claythorn: Doctor Baldwin is examining him right now.
Lady Claythorn: He will likely tell us more later.
She then sits down in her chair.
Everyone looks shaken up.
Sushil Sinha: How terrible.
Amelia Baxter: Yes, such sad news.
We continue eating slowly in silence for a moment when the doctor enters the room.
Lady Claythorn: Doctor Baldwin, can you tell us more about what happened?
Daniel Baldwin: I can't say anything definitive for now.
Daniel Baldwin: But it's very likely a natural death, possibly triggered by an old wound from the war.
Daniel Baldwin: In any case, we need to call the authorities.
Lady Claythorn: Yes, of course.
Lady Claythorn: My butler will take care of it.
Daniel Baldwin: Very well.
We then continue eating in sad silence.
Nobody speaks much.
When everyone is done eating, Lady Claythorn speaks up.
Lady Claythorn: Well, as I mentioned earlier, activities were planned for today.
Lady Claythorn: This morning, those who wished to were supposed to go on a hunt.
Lady Claythorn: A sad event has happened, but it's not a reason to remain idle.
Lady Claythorn: So, if no one objects, I propose that we continue according to what was planned.
A murmur of assent runs through the assembly.
Lady Claythorn: Excellent.
Lady Claythorn: Everything is ready for those who wish to join the hunt.
Lady Claythorn: I know most of you are probably not accustomed to this type of event.
Lady Claythorn: That's why our staff can lend you everything you'll need—clothes, guns—and they will also assist you throughout the event.
Lady Claythorn: Of course, you can choose to simply stay here.
Lady Claythorn: You can relax and enjoy the warmth of the house until the others return.
A hunt... A true aristocratic hunt.
Now that's something to witness.
It's not as if I'll get this opportunity often.
And I might not be the only one feeling out of place, especially if Lady Claythorn is right.
So there's no need for embarrassment.
However, I've never even held a gun in my life.
Those older men might not be of the gentry, but they likely learned to shoot during the war.
What should I do?
Menu Choice: Stay here where it's cosy
I turned down the invitation for the hunt.
So, I'm staying inside with Amelia Baxter and Rosalind Marsh.
They are in the tea room, waiting for a small luncheon to be served.
Now, what should I do?
Map Choice: Richard III Bedroom
I slowly enter the unlocked door.
It's Thomas Moody's.
His lifeless body lies on the bed.
I don't know what morbid curiosity led me here.
Gosh.
Now that I'm here, perhaps I should take a quick look.
There might be something that helps me understand what happened.
I look around the room.
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
He looks peaceful.
His mask is still on.
The doctor didn't even remove it for the examination.
Well, if the doctor didn't, I certainly won't either.
On a chair next to the bed, his clothes are meticulously folded.
There's a whisky flask on the nightstand.
It's on its side, empty.
Next to it is a stain.
I suppose it's whisky, but it's an odd shade of green.
That's peculiar.
What could it be?
That's all I notice in the room.
Map Choice: George IV Bedroom
I knock on the door.
Nobody answers.
After knocking, the door slightly opens.
It was not even closed.
Most people are out for the hunt, so I guess I could try to enter the room anyway.
But it won't look good if I get caught.
What should I do?
Menu Choice: Let's go in. What's the worst that could happen?
I cautiously push the door open, ensuring no one sees me.
The bedroom is messy and dimly lit and the smell of alcohol fills the air.
There are clothes all over the floor.
I think I can safely say it's Samuel Manning's room.
I quickly scan the room but only find empty whisky bottles.
As I'm about to leave, a piece of white paper in the fireplace catches my eye.
Driven by curiosity, I pick it up.
The writing on the paper is almost entirely burned.
I can only read some of it.
There is a first part, written with an impeccable style.
Letter: *** treated yo***
Letter: ** recovered ***
Letter: Do what you ****.
Below, another message is scribbled in a barely legible hand:
Letter: The b*****
Letter: ***** hesitate.
Even though its meaning eludes me, this letter seems significant.
I decide to keep it, just in case.
Map Choice: George I Bedroom
I knock on the door.
Nobody answers.
There seems to be nobody here as well.
Menu Choice: It won't hurt to give it a try. Let's go in and find out.
I try to push the door open.
It's locked.
Map Choice: Edward II Bedroom
I knock on the door.
Nobody answers.
There seems to be nobody here as well.
Menu Choice: Let's enter and see what happens. It can't be that bad.
I try to push the door open.
It's locked.
Map Choice: Queen Alexandra
I knock on the door.
Nobody answers.
There seems to be nobody here as well.
Menu Choice: What's the harm in entering? Let's go!
I try to push the door open.
It's locked.
Map Choice: Henry IV Bedroom
I knock on the door.
Nobody answers.
There seems to be nobody here as well.
Menu Choice: Come on, let's go inside. What could go wrong?
I try to push the door open.
It's locked.
Map Choice: Elizabeth I Bedroom
I knock on the door.
Nobody answers.
There seems to be nobody here as well.
Menu Choice: Shall we enter? It's not like you'd be in any danger anyway.
I try to push the door open.
It's locked.
Map Choice: Garage
Let's see if I can check downstairs now.
I walk down the stairs slowly, being very careful not to attract attention.
But as I'm stepping down to the basement, the same woman stops me.
Young woman: You again, Sir? As I already told you, I'm afraid you're not allowed to be here.
Ted Harring: Of course, I was just lost. I'm terribly sorry.
Young woman: It's alright, don't worry about it, sir.
I'd better be careful. If I'm caught here a third time, it will really start to look suspicious.
Map Choice: Garden
A beautiful garden.
I wandered in it for a while, enjoying a relaxing walk.
But I didn't find anything of interest.
Map Choice: Entrance Hall
It's certainly an impressive entrance hall.
Nobody is here.
Map Choice: Dining Room
The dining room is empty at the moment.
I shouldn't stay here.
Map Choice: Billiard room
It's empty.
No need to stay here.
Map Choice: Portrait Gallery
That's a creepy portrait gallery.
I don't recognize anyone, so I guess these are people from the Claythorn family.
Map Choice: Library
There is nothing different from the last time I was in here.
No reason to look further.
Map Choice: Meet the others in the Tea Room
Amelia Baxter and Rosalind Marsh are in the room.
They're drinking tea and talking calmly.
I join them.
Rosalind Marsh: Oh Mr Harring, I'm glad you're here.
Rosalind Marsh: Miss Baxter and I were just discussing something fascinating.
Rosalind Marsh: You should join us.
Ted Harring: Of course, I'd be happy to chat with you for a bit.
Ted Harring: What were you talking about?
Rosalind Marsh: Miss Baxter was talking about how she can communicate with the dead.
Ted Harring: Really? That's fascinating.
Amelia Baxter: Yes, but to not bore Miss Marsh, I won't go into the details again.
Amelia Baxter: But if you're interested, we can discuss it another time.
Rosalind Marsh: Anyway, you mentioned being concerned about the man who died last night.
Amelia Baxter: That's correct. I have a feeling that something is off about his death.
Rosalind Marsh: What do you mean?
Amelia Baxter: I sense his spirit, and it's restless. It's a sign of an unnatural death.
Amelia Baxter: There's something amiss, I just can't figure what.
Amelia Baxter: But I don't mean to alarm you.
Amelia Baxter: It might be nothing.
Amelia Baxter: In any case, we'll know more once the police arrive.
Ted Harring: That's true. We're still waiting for them, right?
Ted Harring: But Lady Claythorn left and didn't assign anyone to handle this matter?
Amelia Baxter: Well, she has staff to manage such situations.
Ted Harring: Ah, like the girl I encountered when I tried to go downstairs.
Amelia Baxter: What were you attempting to do downstairs?
Amelia Baxter: That area isn't somewhere we should wander into, Mr Harring.
Amelia Baxter: Regardless, there are probably many staff members you haven't met yet.
Amelia Baxter: Such a large house requires a sizable team.
Amelia Baxter: So, don't worry. There will definitely be someone available to talk with the police.
Rosalind Marsh: Indeed, and it might take a while for the police to get here.
Rosalind Marsh: It's not a pressing emergency. They might not arrive until later this evening.
It's creepy to realize there's a dead man upstairs.
He's there in his bed, as if nothing happened.
Strange.
While we talk, someone enters the room.
Young woman: I'm glad to find you all here.
Young woman: I've prepared a light luncheon.
Young woman: Would you like me to bring it over?
Amelia Baxter: Thank you, Miss. That sounds wonderful.
Amelia Baxter: But I must ask, did you cook it?
Amelia Baxter: Aren't you the maid? I thought I saw you tidying my room earlier.
Young woman: Well, ... the truth is, I am the cook. But I occasionally assist as a maid when needed.
Amelia Baxter: A cook and a maid? That's quite the workload.
Young woman: Don't be concerned for me. I can manage.
Young woman: I'll fetch your meal now.
She exits the room.
Amelia Baxter: It seems worse than I initially thought. A cook who also acts as a maid.
Amelia Baxter: That's rather unusual.
Miss Marsh and I stay silent.
Perhaps she's as clueless as I am about the workings of this household.
Or she might be refraining from criticising our host.
After a moment, the cook returns with our food, and we enjoy a light chat while dining.
Once we're done, Rosalind Marsh stands up.
Rosalind Marsh: That was delightful.
Rosalind Marsh: If you'll excuse me, I need to rest in my room for a bit.
Rosalind Marsh: The storm kept me awake most of the night.
Amelia Baxter: Certainly, we understand.
Amelia Baxter: See you later.
Rosalind Marsh leaves the tea room.
I'm left with Amelia Baxter.
Amelia Baxter: It seems it's just you and me, Mr Harring.
Suddenly, I hear noises from the entrance hall.
I decide to see what's happening.
I watch the hunting party enter the house.
Amelia and Rosalind are already there, near the entrance.
Lady Claythorn enters first, looking visibly shocked.
Then the butler and footman follow.
They're dragging someone on a makeshift stretcher.
Amelia Baxter: Oh my God! What happened!?
Amelia Baxter: Is that Doctor Baldwin? Is he injured?
Amelia Baxter: Oh no! Is he... dead?
Sushil Sinha: I'm sorry, dear, but he is.
Amelia Baxter: But... what happened?
Sushil Sinha: It was an accident.
Samuel Manning: I swear it was! I have no idea how I could have hit him.
Samuel Manning: I was aiming at a rabbit. I didn't even see him.
Everyone turns to him.
Amelia Baxter: You fool! You were probably too drunk, and that's why you hit him.
Amelia Baxter: You could barely walk this morning. Who gave you a gun?
Sushil Sinha: Please, there's no need to point fingers now. It's done.
Sushil Sinha: The police will handle it.
Sushil Sinha: Speaking of which, has anyone from the city arrived yet?
Amelia Baxter: No, not yet.
Amelia Baxter: We're still waiting for them.
Sushil Sinha: We should tell them to hurry.
Sushil Sinha: Lady Claythorn, where's the phone?
Lady Claythorn: I'll handle it.
She leaves the group, with the butler following closely behind.
The room falls silent.
Most eyes are on Sam Manning, filled with disdain.
Then, the hostess returns.
Lady Claythorn: I just spoke with the police. They aren't coming today.
Sushil Sinha: What!? Why not?
Lady Claythorn: They were on their way but encountered a huge tree blocking the road.
Lady Claythorn: They couldn't get past it.
Lady Claythorn: They said they'll be back tomorrow with assistance.
Amelia Baxter: But... what are we going to do with him until then?
Sushil Sinha: We'll move him to his bed for now.
Sushil Sinha: It's the best we can do under the circumstances.
Sushil Sinha: Anyone willing to help?
Ted Harring: I will.
We carried Doctor Baldwin to his room and laid him on his bed.
Sushil then covered him with a blanket.
Sushil Sinha: It's the best we can do at the moment.
Sushil Sinha: We shouldn't linger here.
Sushil Sinha: I want to keep an eye on Samuel Manning.
Ted Harring: Of course.
Sushil Sinha: Also Mr Harring, you might want to change before rejoining us.
I glance at my clothes.
They're stained with blood.
He is right, I can't go back downstairs looking like this.
So, I retreated to my room to fetch clean clothes.
I also took the opportunity to have a bath.
As I was preparing to go downstairs again, someone knocked on my door.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, may I come in?
Amelia Baxter... What does she want?
Ted Harring: Come on in, Mrs. Baxter. The door is open.
Amelia Baxter: I'm sorry to intrude, but I believe we should talk.
She doesn't wait for an answer and begins explaining.
Amelia Baxter: Something dangerous is happening here.
Ted Harring: What do you mean?
Amelia Baxter: Don't you find it strange that two different people died in the same place, from two different causes?
Ted Harring: Well, I don't know about Thomas Moody.
Ted Harring: But for the doctor's death, you said it yourself: Samuel Manning was probably drunk.
Ted Harring: That's tragic, but not really surprising.
Amelia Baxter: That's what I initially thought.
Amelia Baxter: However, I just spoke with the butler. He insisted that Samuel Manning was clear-minded when he handed him his gun.
Ted Harring: So, what, you think he staged the accident?
Ted Harring: He might've just drank too much during the hunt.
Amelia Baxter: Possibly, but it's still suspicious.
Amelia Baxter: I have other reasons to believe something is amiss here.
Amelia Baxter: Let's just say, I have a feeling.
Ted Harring: You can "feel" it?
Amelia Baxter: Don't dismiss what you don't understand, Mr Harring.
Amelia Baxter: But it's okay. I don't need you to believe me.
Amelia Baxter: I'm simply warning you to be cautious.
Ted Harring: Are you scared of Samuel Manning?
Amelia Baxter: Yes, but not just him.
Amelia Baxter: Others might be involved too.
Amelia Baxter: I don't think we can trust anyone fully.
Ted Harring: Yet, you seem to trust me.
Amelia Baxter: Well, I wouldn't put it that way.
Amelia Baxter: If someone were after me, I'd be defenseless. So, I need an ally.
Amelia Baxter: You seem capable of defending both of us if there's a direct confrontation.
Amelia Baxter: So, I chose to confide in you.
I'm at a loss for words.
A murder?
She is probably paranoid.
But still...
The gong sounds.
Everything that happened didn't disturbed the order of the house, it seems.
Amelia Baxter: It is dinner time.
Amelia Baxter: Not that I'm particularly hungry.
Amelia Baxter: But we should head downstairs regardless.
I nod in agreement.
Amelia Baxter: I believe we should continue this conversation later.
Amelia Baxter: If you agree, come see me in my room after dinner.
Amelia Baxter: I'm in the "Elizabeth I" room.
As I enter the room, the atmosphere is gloomy.
The seats of Daniel Baldwin and Thomas Moody are empty.
Samuel Manning is also absent.
I take my usual seat, with only Amelia Baxter beside me now.
Lady Claythorn starts a speech.
Lady Claythorn: Now that everyone is here, I want to express my deepest regret for what happened today.
Lady Claythorn: This isn't how I imagined our weekend.
Lady Claythorn: I don't believe any of us are in the mood for more entertainment.
Lady Claythorn: So, tomorrow morning, you'll receive your rewards.
Lady Claythorn: Afterward, we'll wait for the police to arrive.
Lady Claythorn: You're free to head home as soon as the officers give the all-clear.
Lady Claythorn: For now, enjoy your dinner.
Lady Claythorn: Drinks will be available in the billiard room afterwards, as they were yesterday.
The food is served shortly after the speech.
Yet, most of us have little appetite.
Ted Harring: Miss Baxter, I don't see Samuel Manning.
Ted Harring: Do you know where he might be?
Amelia Baxter: He's locked in his room.
Amelia Baxter: After you left, there was a debate about how to handle him.
Amelia Baxter: Ultimately, we decided it best to confine him to his room.
Amelia Baxter: He didn't resist.
Amelia Baxter: That's where he is now.
Amelia Baxter: It was agreed that his dinner would be served there.
Well, that's one less thing to worry about.
No one seems up for small talk.
Dinner passes in silence.
Most guests retire to their rooms after eating.
Given the day's events, I doubt many are in the mood for drinks.
What should I do next?
Map Choice: Edward II Bedroom
I didn't have time earlier to take a good look at the room.
It feels a little weird being in here, but I might as well look for something useful.
I search his personal effects when I stumble upon his medication suitcase.
There's nothing out of the ordinary in there.
A stethoscope, bandages, a few bottles of medication,...
There's one in particular that he has more of than the others.
"Laudanum" is written on the label.
He has almost a dozen of those bottles.
Laudanum... I've heard of that before.
It's essentially opium.
It looks like the doctor wasn't using it only on patients.
Just in case, I might as well take a few for myself.
Map Choice: Richard III Bedroom
Although I've been here before, I can't shake the feeling I should inspect the room once more.
Yet, everything looks the same as I remember.
Perhaps I should look elsewhere.
Map Choice: George IV Bedroom
I knock on the door.
Samuel Manning: Grrr, Mrrrr, Errrr
I can hear Samuel Manning's voice, but it's incoherent and he's mostly just moaning.
It's pretty clear that he's blind drunk.
I know that the door is closed, so there's no point in trying to enter.
Map Choice: Queen Alexandra
I knock on the door.
A low voice answers.
Rosalind Marsh: Yes? What is it?
Ted Harring: Miss Marsh, it's Ted Harring.
Ted Harring: I was wondering if we could talk.
Rosalind Marsh: It's incredibly late, Mr Harring.
Rosalind Marsh: Can't it wait until the morning?
Ted Harring: Yes, of course, sorry for disturbing you.
Map Choice: Henry IV Bedroom
I knock on the door.
Nobody answers.
Should I try to enter anyway?
No, that's probably a bad idea.
Everyone is in the house now, so it would be too risky.
Map Choice: George I Bedroom
I knock on the door.
Nobody answers.
Should I try to enter anyway?
No, that's probably a bad idea.
Everyone is in the house now, so it would be too risky.
Map Choice: Have a talk with Amelia Baxter
Ted Harring: Miss Baxter?
Ted Harring: Are you here? It's Ted Harring.
She slightly opens the door and looks in the hallway.
She seems worried.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, are you alone?
Ted Harring: I am.
Amelia Baxter: Come on in then.
Amelia Baxter: So, have you given any thought to what I told you?
Amelia Baxter: Do you agree that something isn't right?
Menu Choice: Admit she might be right
Ted Harring: I'm not sure yet. But what happened is strange enough that we should take some precautions.
Amelia Baxter: I'm glad you agree.
Amelia Baxter: I've given this a lot of thought, and I believe if what I fear is true, Samuel Manning had help from someone else.
Ted Harring: Do you mean a guest? Or could someone from the staff be involved?
Amelia Baxter: I wouldn't rule anything out, but it seems less likely that the staff or Lady Claythorn would be implicated.
Amelia Baxter: Such an act would require a massive operation.
Amelia Baxter: No, a more plausible theory is that one or two individuals heard about the event and took the places of real guests to infiltrate the manor.
Ted Harring: But why would they do that?
Amelia Baxter: Well, it's rather obvious, isn't it?
Amelia Baxter: The prize money, of course.
Amelia Baxter: It was mentioned in the invitation letter that the prize will be given in bearer's bonds.
Ted Harring: Bearer's bonds?
Amelia Baxter: That's a note that you can exchange at the bank without having to prove your identity.
Amelia Baxter: So, it's almost as easy to use as cash.
Ted Harring: That's a lot of money hidden somewhere in the manor.
Ted Harring: So you think it could be a mere robbery?
Ted Harring: Why not just directly attack the manor?
Amelia Baxter: It's easier to enter incognito.
Amelia Baxter: First, observe and then discreetly eliminate potential threats.
Amelia Baxter: That's the most likely explanation I could think of.
Ted Harring: I suppose that's possible.
Ted Harring: But there's no way to determine who might be involved.
Amelia Baxter: Exactly.
Amelia Baxter: That's why I suggest we stay safely in our rooms tonight.
Amelia Baxter: Tomorrow morning, the first one of us to wake up should alert the other.
Amelia Baxter: Then we stick together the entire day until we can safely leave.
Amelia Baxter: What do you think?
Ted Harring: It sounds like a good plan.
Ted Harring: Let's do it.
Amelia Baxter: Great!
Amelia Baxter: Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
Menu Choice: Which guests do you think could be dangerous?
Amelia Baxter: Good question, we'll be stronger if we know who to be wary of.
Amelia Baxter: I've thought about it and Samuel Manning is of course the prime suspect.
Amelia Baxter: But he is locked in his room now, so I wouldn't worry about him too much.
Amelia Baxter: The other obvious suspect is Thomas Moody.
Amelia Baxter: The fact that he wears a mask is the perfect way to hide his true identity.
Amelia Baxter: But he can't really hurt us anymore, can he?
Amelia Baxter: So that leaves us three persons to worry about: Sushil Sinha, Lady Claythorn and Rosalind Marsh.
Menu Choice: What do you think of Rosalind Marsh?
Amelia Baxter: Miss Marsh definitely doesn't have the type of a killer.
Amelia Baxter: But that's not reason enough to think she couldn't be.
Amelia Baxter: She is very discreet.
Amelia Baxter: That could be a way to search the manor while she relies on an accomplice for the more "physical" part of the robbery.
Menu Choice: What do you think of Lady Claythorn?
Amelia Baxter: If money is not the reason behind the murders, then I suppose she would be suspicious.
Amelia Baxter: After all, she is the one who called all of us here.
Amelia Baxter: But as I said, it would be a lot of work to organise all this, and for what?
Amelia Baxter: To kill a few of her enemies?
Amelia Baxter: That seems a bit far-fetched.
Amelia Baxter: Also, she seemed very nice to me.
Amelia Baxter: But of course that doesn't mean much.
Ted Harring: I think I should keep looking around the manor. I might learn something useful.
Amelia Baxter: It's not a bad idea. I will stay here tonight if you don't mind.
Amelia Baxter: Good luck.
Ted Harring: Thanks.
Wandering through this house has taken its toll.
And with everything that happened today, I'm drained.
I should go back to my room.
Before trying to sleep, it seems a good idea to barricade the door with some furniture.
You can't be too cautious.
That should be enough.
Now, I can rest peacefully.
I am awaken by the sound of frantic knocking at the door.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, are you there?
Miss Baxter?
Right, we agreed to wake each other up.
I just didn't expect it to be this early.
Ted Harring: I'm coming!
I quickly get dressed and open the door.
Amelia Baxter enters, looking visibly nervous.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Haring, I believe my hunch was right yesterday.
Amelia Baxter: Something strange is afoot.
Ted Harring: What do you mean?
Amelia Baxter: I haven't seen any staff members on my way here.
Amelia Baxter: At this hour, they should be busy with lighting fires, cleaning and setting up breakfast.
Amelia Baxter: Yet, I neither saw nor heard anyone.
Amelia Baxter: It's as silent as a graveyard in here.
Ted Harring: Are you sure it's not just because it's so early?
Amelia Baxter: I'm certain.
Amelia Baxter: I was up at the same time yesterday, and the house was bustling with activity.
Amelia Baxter: Something's not right, I assure you.
Ted Harring: Okay, if you say so.
Ted Harring: But how is that related to a robbery?
Amelia Baxter: I'm not so sure anymore that this is about a robbery.
Amelia Baxter: I have a feeling it could be something much worse.
A chill goes through my body.
Worse than a robbery? What could she mean?
But I'm hesitant to ask her.
Instead, I try to appear confident.
Ted Harring: Alright, we'd better investigate then.
Map Choice: Garden
We venture out to explore the garden.
But there's no trace of anyone.
Lady Claythorn's car isn't there either.
I try shouting to attract attention.
Ted Harring: Hello! Is anyone here?
Ted Harring: Hello!!
No response.
Amelia Baxter: I don't think shouting will help.
Amelia Baxter: If someone's here, we'll find them.
Oh, was shouting inappropriate?
I guess she'll always prioritize decorum, no matter the situation.
Let's head back inside then.
Map Choice: Billiard room
The billiard room is empty.
But the drinks remain untouched.
Perhaps I should have a drink to calm my nerves.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, you aren't considering drinking at this hour, are you?
Ted Harring: Uh, no, of course not.
That's probably wiser.
Let's explore further.
Map Choice: Entrance Hall
The entrance hall is usually the heart of the house.
But there's no activity today.
Just in case, I try to call out for someone.
Ted Harring: Is anyone here?
I didn't really expect an answer.
But an authoritative voice echoes from up the stairs.
Sushil Sinha: Who goes there?
Ted Harring: It's Ted Harring. I'm down here, and Amelia Baxter's with me.
Sushil Sinha: Understood. I'm on my way down.
Soon enough, Captain Sinha comes into view, descending the staircase to join us on the ground floor.
Sushil Sinha: At last, living, breathing souls.
Sushil Sinha: I was starting to feel like I was in a ghost house.
Amelia Baxter: We feel the same. You're the first person we've encountered today as well.
Ted Harring: Do you have any idea what's going on?
Sushil Sinha: Nothing concrete. All I know is, I don't like it.
Sushil Sinha: People don't just vanish from their homes without reason.
Amelia Baxter: They certainly don't.
Sushil Sinha: And then there's the matter of the suspicious deaths.
Sushil Sinha: I could've dismissed them as bad luck yesterday, but now... I'm not so certain.
The conversation lingers in the air, a heavy silence stretching between us.
Amelia Baxter: Staying put won't give us any answers.
Amelia Baxter: We need to continue exploring the house.
Sushil Sinha: Agreed. Should we search together?
Amelia Baxter: Thank you, but... maybe it's better to split up.
Amelia Baxter: We'd cover more ground that way.
Amelia seemed nervous when she answered.
Sushil Sinha: Makes sense. Let's proceed on our own and regroup later.
Sushil Sinha: How about the tea room?
Amelia Baxter: That sounds good.
Amelia Baxter: See you there.
Map Choice: Dining Room
Ted Harring: Nobody seems to be here.
Amelia Baxter: And the table isn't set for breakfast either.
Amelia Baxter: That's unusual.
Map Choice: Go wait for Sushil
I doubt we'll find anyone now.
So we settled in the tea room to wait for Captain Sinha.
Sushil Sinha: It's unbelievable, but it seems we're the only three living souls left here.
Sushil Sinha: Did you find anything?
Ted Harring: Nothing.
Ted Harring: It seems everyone is gone.
Ted Harring: Except for the bodies.
Ted Harring: By the way, did you check on Samuel Manning?
Ted Harring: You're the only one with the key to his room.
Sushil Sinha: No, not yet. I assumed he couldn't have gone far.
Sushil Sinha: But you're right, we should check on him.
Ted Harring: I think so too.
Ted Harring: We'll follow you.
Amelia shoots me a concerned look but remains silent.
She follows us nonetheless.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Manning, are you there?
No response.
Sushil Sinha: Alright, I'm going in.
He unlocks the door, and we trail behind him.
But as I step inside, Captain Sinha tries to halt us.
Sushil Sinha: Wait! Don't come in.
But it's already too late.
The sight inside is beyond horrifying.
Samuel Manning lies in his bed, drenched in blood, his throat slashed multiple times.
Pale as a sheet, his eyes frozen in a blank stare.
Miss Baxter almost screams.
Sushil Sinha: Miss Baxter, please don't stay here.
She's speechless, her gaze fixed on the horrifying scene.
Sushil Sinha gently pulls her arm, leading her out. I quickly follow.
Sushil Sinha: I regret letting you see that.
Sushil Sinha: You shouldn't have entered.
Amelia Baxter: Is... is he... dead?
Sushil Sinha: I'm afraid so.
Ted Harring: Are you certain?
Ted Harring: Shouldn't we check his pulse?
Ted Harring: Maybe... just maybe, there's a chance he's alive.
My voice trembles as I speak, realisation dawning on me.
Sushil Sinha: I'm sorry, but it's too late.
Sushil Sinha: I've seen enough dead people to know. He's been gone for a long time.
Sushil Sinha: Likely since last night.
Amelia Baxter: Oh my God.
The weight of shock renders me motionless.
To help us recover, Sushil guides us back to the tea room.
Sushil Sinha: Miss Baxter, you should probably rest here for a little bit.
Sushil Sinha: I have something to check out, and I'll be back soon.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Harring, would you mind coming with me?
I'm still shaken from what we saw, but doing something might help me recover my senses.
Ted Harring: Well, sure.
Ted Harring: I'll follow you.
Amelia Baxter: Please don't be long.
Sushil Sinha: Don't worry, this should only take a few minutes.
He walks back up the stairs and stands in front of another room.
Sushil Sinha: It's Miss Marsh's room.
Sushil Sinha: When I tried the handle earlier it was locked.
Sushil Sinha: At the time, I didn't dare to go further.
Sushil Sinha: But now, I fear we may have no choice.
Ted Harring: Do you believe she might still be inside?
Ted Harring: Then she would be...
Sushil Sinha: Dead, I am afraid.
Sushil Sinha: After what we witnessed, I think it a very strong possibility.
Ted Harring: Oh my God.
Sushil Sinha: There is no need to break the door.
Sushil Sinha: The butler entrusted me with a master key when we confined Mr Manning.
Sushil Sinha: It should open every room in the house.
He has a master key?
That mean he is able to visit every room of this place.
Captain Sinha then slips a small key from his pocket.
With a steady hand he turns the lock.
The mechanism clicks, and the door swings open into the silence beyond.
The room is eerily quiet.
But Rosalind Marsh is not there.
We look in every corner, but we can't find anything of interest.
Ted Harring: What a relief.
Sushil Sinha: Yes, of course. But there's no need to linger here.
Sushil Sinha: Let's return to the tea room, we need to talk with Miss Baxter to decide our next steps.
Amelia Baxter: You've been gone for a while. What happened?
Sushil Sinha: I'm afraid we haven't been able to find Miss Marsh.
Sushil Sinha: Her room was locked, so we forced it open.
Sushil Sinha: But it was all for naught, as it was empty.
Amelia Baxter: Well, what should we do now?
Sushil Sinha: You both seem a bit shaken up.
Sushil Sinha: That's not surprising, given what you've witnessed.
Sushil Sinha: It's easier for me.
Sushil Sinha: Sadly, I've seen my share of dead people.
Sushil Sinha: So I suggest you two rest for a bit while I continue to explore the manor.
Sushil Sinha: I'll be back soon.
I feel like I should accompany him.
But he is right, I am exhausted and overwhelmed.
So I just agree with a nod and sit down.
We stayed in the tea room and gathered our strength while Sushil Sinha kept searching the manor.
When he returned, we had started to feel a bit better.
Sushil Sinha: I believe I've looked absolutely everywhere now.
Sushil Sinha: There is no trace of anyone.
Sushil Sinha: I also tried to use the telephone, and it's not working.
Sushil Sinha: Thus, there is no way for us to call for help.
Sushil Sinha: The way I see it now, we don't have many options left.
Sushil Sinha: I believe we must leave this place.
Sushil Sinha: The longer we stay, the more at risk we are.
Amelia Baxter: But... shouldn't we wait for the police?
Amelia Baxter: They were expected today. They could arrive any moment.
Sushil Sinha: I wouldn't count on it.
Sushil Sinha: From what I gather, there's no evidence that the police were called yesterday.
Amelia Baxter: But Miss Claythorn said...
Amelia Baxter: She said...
She stops mid-sentence, realising the implication.
Amelia Baxter: I see, you believe she never called.
Amelia Baxter: That the police have no idea about what's happened here.
Amelia Baxter: That she lied to us.
Sushil Sinha: That's the most logical explanation.
Sushil Sinha: No one was around when the phone calls were supposedly made.
Sushil Sinha: So, there's no way to verify if they actually happened.
Ted Harring: But why?
Ted Harring: Why would anyone do this?
Ted Harring: I don't understand what's happening.
Sushil Sinha: Neither do I.
Sushil Sinha: I've thought about it, and I have no clue why we were all invited here.
Sushil Sinha: I'm certain it wasn't to give us any money.
Sushil Sinha: In any case, all I know is we need to leave as soon as possible.
Amelia Baxter: But how could we leave?
Amelia Baxter: The nearest town is miles away.
Amelia Baxter: I can't walk that far.
Amelia Baxter: And even if I could, I'm not prepared for such a journey.
Captain Sinha and I consider this for a moment.
Sushil Sinha: You might be right.
Sushil Sinha: It would be a long walk, and the weather might turn at any moment.
Sushil Sinha: We could get caught in another storm.
Sushil Sinha: It's probably unsafe for you to join us.
Amelia Baxter: But you're not going to leave me here alone, are you?
Amelia Baxter: What would become of me?
Sushil Sinha: We could lock you in a room.
Sushil Sinha: Though, that's far from ideal.
Sushil Sinha: Perhaps one of us should stay with you.
Amelia Baxter: Yes!
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring can stay with me, right?
Amelia Baxter: The two of us should be safe until you return with help.
Sushil Sinha: That seems to be the wisest choice.
Sushil Sinha: What do you think, Mr Harring?
Menu Choice: Follow Sushil Sinha. Amelia Baxter will probably be fine on her own
Ted Harring: I think I should come with you.
Ted Harring: It would be safer for both of us.
Ted Harring: We don't know what's outside.
Sushil Sinha: Alright, that's settled then.
Amelia Baxter: What?!
Amelia Baxter: You can't abandon me here!
Amelia Baxter: There's a killer in this house.
Amelia Baxter: When you come back, I might be dead.
Sushil Sinha: There's no need to be so dramatic.
Sushil Sinha: If you lock yourself in your room, you'll likely be safe.
Amelia Baxter: Really? Like Mr Manning was safe?
Sushil Sinha: That's different. Samuel Manning didn't expect anyone would come for him.
Sushil Sinha: He was probably killed in his sleep.
Sushil Sinha: Or maybe he took his own life.
Sushil Sinha: For you, it'll be different. You'll be on your guard.
Amelia Baxter: What good will that do when someone breaks down my door?
He ponders this for a second.
Sushil Sinha: Right. You might need a gun to defend yourself.
Sushil Sinha: Here, take this one.
He hands her a small gun.
Amelia Baxter: But... I don't know how to use this!
Sushil Sinha: It's simple. If someone breaks down your bedroom door, just point it at them and press the trigger.
Sushil Sinha: That's all there is to it.
Amelia Baxter: I don't know if I can do that, I...
Sushil Sinha: I know you can.
Sushil Sinha: Now, go to your room and lock the door.
Sushil Sinha: Maybe even move some furniture in front of it.
Sushil Sinha: If anyone other than us tries to enter, shoot them.
Sushil Sinha: Understood?
Amelia Baxter is visibly terrified.
But the natural authority of Sushil Sinha makes her nod in agreement.
Sushil Sinha: Good.
Sushil Sinha: We'll leave you for now. Time is of the essence.
Sushil Sinha: But we will come back for you, I promise.
Without waiting for a reply, he gestures for me to follow him to the entrance hall.
Sushil Sinha: Let's go, Mr Harring. The sooner, the better.
We leave Amelia Baxter behind and exit the manor.
Sushil Sinha: It was rather ungentlemanly to leave her alone like that.
Sushil Sinha: But I understand. I wouldn't want to remain in this house any longer than necessary either.
He says he understands, but his expression suggests disapproval.
He likely would have preferred if I stayed in the house.
Sushil Sinha: In any case, this won't be an easy journey.
Sushil Sinha: The roads are probably still muddy, and if I recall correctly, the distance to the next house is at least 10 miles.
Sushil Sinha: Maybe even more.
Sushil Sinha: It will likely take us a few hours on the road.
With that, he begins moving towards the exit gate.
We had been walking for about two hours when he stops.
Sushil Sinha: Wait!
Sushil Sinha: Did you hear that?
Ted Harring: Not really.
Ted Harring: What is it?
Sushil Sinha: I heard footsteps from the forest.
Sushil Sinha: I think someone's following us.
Ted Harring: What?!
Sushil Sinha: Keep quiet.
Sushil Sinha: Pretend nothing's wrong.
Ted Harring: What should we do?
Ted Harring: Should we make a run for it?
Sushil Sinha: No, I'll try to ambush him.
Sushil Sinha: I think I've pinpointed his location.
Sushil Sinha: I'll charge at him.
Sushil Sinha: When I give the signal, start running on the road to divert his attention.
Sushil Sinha: I'll dash into the forest to try and disarm him.
Sushil Sinha: Ready?
Ted Harring: What?! No!
Ted Harring: This is too risky!
Sushil Sinha: Trust me, it'll work.
Sushil Sinha: On my mark.
Sushil Sinha: Three.
Sushil Sinha: Two.
Sushil Sinha: One.
Sushil Sinha: Go!
Before I can even think, I start running.
A gunshot rings out.
I glance back to see Sushil Sinha collapsing to the ground.
But I can't stop.
My legs push me forward faster than ever before.
I've never run this fast in my entire life.
Minutes later, I'm gasping for breath.
I'm not sprinting anymore, just jogging — barely faster than a brisk walk.
But I have to keep going.
I find a nearly comfortable pace and maintain it, occasionally glancing behind me.
Thankfully, no one is in sight.
After what felt like an eternity, I finally reached the town.
I rushed into the police station and told them everything.
I was exhausted, panicked, and probably came off as unhinged.
Yet, they agreed to investigate the matter.
I was too drained and frightened to accompany them, but they told me everything when they came back.
They discovered Sushil Sinha's body on the road, likely where I last saw him.
He'd been shot in the head.
At that moment, the two police officers took the situation very seriously.
They rushed to Claythorn Manor.
There, they discovered that all of the remaining guests had died.
Samuel Manning, Thomas Moody, and Daniel Baldwin were still in their beds.
Poor Miss Baxter was found lying lifeless in the hallway.
She didn't even make it to her room.
Rosalind Marsh was dead too.
Her body was found in the attic.
We still have no idea where Lady Claythorn and her staff are.
You made it out alive.
But it's not the perfect ending either.
Don't get me wrong, it's still an impressive feat.
But surviving Claythorn Manor is merely the first step.
Your goal is to save everyone.
And to do that, you need to start the story over.
Select a Character
As I approach my destination, I read the letter that has brought me on this trip for the tenth time.
Letter: 5th September, 1924
Letter: Dear Mr Harring,
Letter: I am pleased to announce that you have been selected as one of the recipients of the "Exceptional Act of Bravery Award".
Letter: You'll be receiving the prize, along with six other courageous individuals, at a reception organised in your honour.
Letter: As a thank you, a weekend of leisure at Claythorn Manor has been planned for all of you to enjoy.
Letter: After which, a prize money of one thousand pounds in bearer's bond will be handed to you.
Letter: Please note that your presence is mandatory in order to receive the prize.
Letter: All you have to do is be at Aberdeen Station, on the 13th of October around 4PM, where someone will drive you to the manor.
Letter: Hoping ,.....
More information follows, but that's about the content of it.
It is signed by "Lady Claythorn".
I've never heard of her.
I couldn't really believe it at first.
I don't think I am that deserving. At least no more than hundreds of other guys in this country.
But no matter the reason, I can't possibly say no to this amount of money.
So I feel as if I do not have much choice.
But still, there is part of me thinking,
Maybe I never should have come.
As I step off the train, a man approaches me.
Footman: Welcome sir. Are you by any chance, heading to Claythorn Manor?
Ted Harring: Yes, as a matter of fact I am.
As proof, I hand him the letter that I still have in my hand.
Footman: Very well Sir. Let me assist you with your luggage and you can follow me into the car.
And just like that, we are on our way.
Ted Harring: So you are lady Claythorn's driver?
Footman: Yes, I mean,.. no.
Footman: I am actually her footman. I also drive people when necessary.
Ted Harring: Oh. The driver must be busy because of all the people coming I guess.
Ted Harring: Do you know how many people have been invited this weekend?
Footman: Well, ... I am not sure sir. Half a dozen at least I believe.
Footman: But I am sorry, I must concentrate on the road ahead. Lady Claythorn doesn't like it when I am distracted.
Ted Harring: Of course, I am sorry.
Footman: No need for apologies Sir.
I seem to have made him uneasy. Maybe he's not used to small talk with guests.
This feels odd, as I'm usually on the other end of this treatment.
I wonder how well I'll blend in with the other folks at the manor.
They might be used to this kind of service.
But then again, maybe not. Maybe Lady Claythorn likes helping people like me.
We'll see.
After we leave Aberdeen, we move into the countryside, then into what seems like a vast forest.
About twenty minutes later, all signs of human life disappear.
It's nothing but dense woodland as far as the eye can see.
The isolation makes me feel a bit uneasy, being so far from everywhere else.
And the look of an approaching storm in the sky only adds to my discomfort.
Eventually, an imposing mansion emerges on the horizon.
It's bigger than any house I've ever been in.
A big country house.
Everyone who was anyone in England used to have one.
Now I've heard a lot of people can't afford them anymore.
They are sold, turned into hotels, or even abandoned. Left there to rot.
What a shame.
As the driver unloads my luggage from the car, I approach the entrance, where a butler opens the door to welcome me.
I step into the most remarkable hall I've ever set foot in.
Butler: Welcome Sir.
Ted Harring: Hello, I am Ted Harring, I have been invited by Lady Claythorn..
Butler: Yes, of course Mr Harring.
Butler: Welcome to Claythorn Manor.
Butler: I am afraid you won't have time to change right now.
Butler: Everyone is already there, and dinner will be ready very soon.
Butler: So if you follow me into the tea room, you can join the rest of the party for some drinks.
Well, it's not like I have multiple changes of clothes anyway. So, I follow him.
As I step into the room, the butler loudly introduces me.
Butler: Mr Ted Harring!
Everyone turns their head towards me.
Some people nod in my direction, while others barely acknowledge my presence.
From afar, the butler provides me with a brief introduction to each guest.
Butler: The older man talking is from India, and his name is Sushil Sinha.
Butler: He is in conversation with Rosalind Marsh...
Butler: .. and with Daniel Baldwin. The man with the glasses.
Butler: Don't be alarmed by the man in the mask.
Butler: He is a war veteran named Thomas Moody.
Butler: The man sitting on the couch, looking rather exhausted is Samuel Manning.
Butler: The older lady in the corner of the room is Amelia Baxter.
Ted Harring: I don't see our host in the room.
Butler: Lady Claythorn is still busy at the moment.
Butler: You'll meet her at dinner.
After this introduction, he leaves me and goes to stand in the corner of the room.
Most of the guests are already engaged in conversation.
However, Amelia Baxter and Samuel Manning are alone.
They seem more approachable than the rest.
Menu Choice: Stand awkwardly in the corner
What is that? A gong?
Butler: Dinner is served. Please, follow me to the dining room.
Everyone takes a seat at the spot labelled with their names.
As I observe each person, Lady Claythorn makes her entrance into the room.
She looks younger than I imagined.
I don't know why, but I pictured an elderly, bored lady. Yet she looks nothing like that.’
Her clothes, which are the most impressive of anyone's in the room, make her status clear.
She proceeds to take her seat at the table.
Lady Claythorn: Welcome, everyone. My apologies for keeping you waiting.
Lady Claythorn: Now that we're all gathered, I'd like to express my gratitude once more.
Lady Claythorn: As you already know, you are here because of the heroic acts you've committed in the past.
Lady Claythorn: I've taken notice of these actions and felt it was my responsibility to extend a formal 'thank you.'
Lady Claythorn: I realize the invitation letter you received was somewhat vague, so let me clarify its contents now.
Lady Claythorn: My first gift to you is a stay at my manor.
Lady Claythorn: You'll be fully catered to, enjoying the most refined food, expertly prepared by my personal chef.
Lady Claythorn: During the three days we'll spend together, we'll also partake in various activities, which I'm sure you'll find enjoyable.
Lady Claythorn: My second gift is a sum of one thousand pounds, to be shared among you.
Lady Claythorn: This is my way of thanking those as selfless as yourselves, who help others without thought of reward.
Following her speech, our host settles back down in her chair.
After the speech, everyone appears pleased.
A few of the guests begin to express their appreciation to the host.
Lady Claythorn: Please, there's no need to thank me.
Lady Claythorn: The food will be served shortly.
Lady Claythorn: Enjoy your meal.
At that moment, the butler enters the room, accompanied by the footman.
They begin to serve the first dish and pour drinks for everyone.
The mood in the room gradually relaxes, and the sound of various conversations fills the space.
I turn my attention to the guests seated next to me.
I find myself sitting between Amelia Baxter and Daniel Baldwin.
Menu Choice: Talk to Daniel Baldwin
Ted Harring: Hello. I am Ted Harring.
Daniel Baldwin: Hi Mr Harring, I am doctor Daniel Baldwin.
Ted Harring: Nice to meet you doctor.
Menu Choice: What do you think of the other guests?
Daniel Baldwin: Oh, I haven't talked to many people so far.
Daniel Baldwin: I think the only person I've heard speak is Mr Sinha.
Daniel Baldwin: And by "heard," I really just mean heard.
Daniel Baldwin: Because I don't think I was able to contribute anything to the conversation.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this weather?
Daniel Baldwin: A dreadful storm, if you ask me.
Daniel Baldwin: I don't know what's planned for tomorrow, but I hope it doesn't involve leaving this house.
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for him
Menu Choice: Talk to Amelia Baxter
Ted Harring: Hi again Miss Baxter.
Amelia Baxter: Hello Mr Harring.
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for her
Menu Choice: Eat in silence, like a sociopath
The dinner comes to an end.
The host explains that we can continue our discussion and enjoy drinks in the billiard room, or, for those tired from the journey, we can simply retire for the night.
Since I haven't seen my room yet, I should probably head there first.
I ask the footman to show me the way.
The footman escorts me up the grand staircase, leading me to the first floor.
Footman: Here you are, sir.
Footman: You've been assigned the "William The Conqueror" room.
I step into the bedroom.
It's more spacious than my apartment, and more luxurious than I could have ever imagined.
Footman: I hope the room suits your taste.
Ted Harring: This is ..., this is good, yes. Thank you.
The footman exits the room.
I look around in disbelief.
After a while, I unpack my modest luggage.
It does not take long. So, what should I do now?
Map Choice: Kitchen
I was on my way to the basement when a young maid stopped me.
Young woman: Hello Sir, may I help you?
Ted Harring: Oh, don't mind me. I'm just taking a look around.
Young woman: I'm sorry, but the basement is off-limits to guests.
Young woman: However, there are plenty of rooms upstairs that you can explore.
Ted Harring: Of course, thank you.
Map Choice: George IV Bedroom
I knock on the door.
Nobody answers.
Should I try to enter anyway?
No, that's probably a bad idea.
Well, I don't know if this is my best idea.
But I guess it didn't feel right to stay behind with the ladies.
Butler: So, this is your first hunt, Mr Harring?
Ted Harring: Yes. I must admit that I don't even know how to use a rifle.
Butler: Not to worry, sir. A footman will follow you and will reload the gun for you.
Butler: All you have to do is point at your target when you encounter something and pull the trigger.
Ted Harring: All right, that sounds easy enough. Will everyone have a footman as well?
Butler: It will be just you, I believe. I will be with Lady Claythorn, and the others insisted they didn't need help.
Of course. So, I'll be the weak link today. Great.
Ted Harring: I see. And what kind of animal are we hunting today?
Butler: I think we will mostly encounter wild birds. But we might also run into some rabbits or even deer.
Ted Harring: Aren't those dangerous?
Butler: Not if you don't get too close to them. And again, you won't be alone, so there's no reason to be scared.
Ted Harring: I am not scared, just curious.
Butler: Right.
Butler: Anyway, you can pick up this gun and wear the clothes I laid out on the table.
Butler: Join the others outside when you're ready.
Ted Harring: Perfect, thanks.
I try on the clothes before me. They fit perfectly.
If something happens to me, at least I'll look good.
I join the others in the garden.
They all look quite comfortable in their hunting clothes.
There's Doctor Baldwin, Sushil Sinha, Lady Claythorn and her staff.
And even Samuel Manning is here.
Wait, what?!
How on earth was he allowed to come with us?
I approach the butler.
Ted Harring: Is it okay for Mr Manning to have a gun? He seemed a bit drunk this morning.
Butler: I was concerned about that at first too. But I just spoke to him, and I can assure you he's perfectly fine.
Butler: He might have been a bit off because of yesterday, but the breakfast and the events of this morning must have sobered him up.
Ted Harring: All right, if you're sure.
Still, I'd better stay away from him.
Butler: Good, now that everyone is ready, I propose we split into two groups.
Butler: It will be easier to spot game that way.
People agree, and Sushil Sinha asks to partner with our host.
The drunk man insists on going with the doctor, who reluctantly accepts.
I am the odd one out.
Which group should I join?
Menu Choice: Daniel Baldwin and Samuel Manning
Despite the risks, I decided to follow Doctor Baldwin and Samuel Manning.
At least this way, I probably won't be the one embarrassing myself.
We walked for a while without encountering anything.
Then, we decided to stop for luncheon.
The four of us sat down in a clearing, sharing a small picnic.
Mr Manning is silent, busy drinking from a pocket flask.
He looks serious, even nervous.
As per usual, the footman doesn't say a word.
That means the doctor and I are the only ones talking.
Daniel Baldwin: So, Mr Harring, how are you finding it here?
Daniel Baldwin: It's a lovely place they have, isn't it?
Ted Harring: Certainly. It's a refreshing change of scenery for me.
Ted Harring: I don't often get to see nature like this.
Daniel Baldwin: Ah, so you're a city chap.
Daniel Baldwin: London?
Ted Harring: Birmingham. I was born and raised there.
But I don't really want to talk about that.
Let's change the subject.
Menu Choice: What do you think of the other guests?
Daniel Baldwin: I haven't spoken in detail with anyone yet.
Daniel Baldwin: So, I don't really have an opinion on the guests.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this weather?
Daniel Baldwin: We are lucky that the weather improved greatly today.
Daniel Baldwin: For a while, I thought we would be trapped inside the manor all weekend.
Daniel Baldwin: But everything seems fine now.
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for him
Our lunch is coming to an end.
Footman: Alright, if everyone's ready, we can continue.
Footman: Hopefully, we'll have better luck this time.
For a while, we didn't.
But then, I spotted something that looked like a rabbit in the distance.
Doctor Baldwin was ahead of me and didn't notice.
I point out my prey to the footman, and he nods in approval.
So, I get into an aiming position.
But as soon as I do, Samuel Manning, who was behind me, sees what's happening.
Samuel Manning: Oh, a rabbit!
He cocks his gun, shaking slightly.
Then, he fires.
He missed by a mile.
By the time I could try again, the rabbit had run off.
I'm frustrated, but then I hear a cry.
I turn around and see Doctor Baldwin crying in pain on the ground.
Daniel Baldwin: Ughhh...
Footman: Sir, are you alright?
I start to call for help.
Ted Harring: Help! Help!!!
Ted Harring: Someone's been shot!
I turn to the footman.
Ted Harring: Hurry, fetch the others.
Footman: Yes, of course, sir.
Samuel Manning: Oh no, what have I done?!
Samuel Manning: It was an accident.
Samuel Manning: I never intended this. Please believe me.
I ignore Samuel Manning's pleas and sit beside the injured man.
I don't know how to help.
But Doctor Baldwin does.
Daniel Baldwin: Quickly, remove my shirt.
Daniel Baldwin: I need to see where the bullet entered.
In my panic, I tear off his shirt, revealing his blood-soaked abdomen.
I notice a small entry wound on his right side.
It doesn't look too bad.
Ted Harring: I've found the wound.
Ted Harring: Should I apply pressure?
The doctor inspects it himself.
A look of dread washes over his face.
Daniel Baldwin: There's no need.
Daniel Baldwin: The bullet has hit my liver.
Ted Harring: But it's just a tiny hole. Maybe we can...
Daniel Baldwin: No, we can't. Liver wounds are fatal.
Daniel Baldwin: It's already too late.
He casts a venomous glare at Samuel Manning but says nothing.
Ted Harring: Is there anything I can do?
Daniel Baldwin: Yes, hand me my bag.
I search around and locate his medical bag.
I pass it to him.
Daniel Baldwin: Well, there's nothing more to do now.
He takes out a small vial and a syringe.
He fills the syringe in. Then, without hesitation, he injects himself.
Then he does it a second time.
And a third.
Daniel Baldwin: Ahhhh, that's better.
This is all happening too quickly.
Ted Harring: What can I do?
Daniel Baldwin: There is nothing to be done.
Daniel Baldwin: I'll lose consciousness soon.
Daniel Baldwin: And likely, I won't awaken again.
I am speechless.
Daniel Baldwin: Perhaps I deserve this.
Ted Harring: Don't say that.
Ted Harring: Your patients would...
Daniel Baldwin: My patients won't care if I live or die.
Daniel Baldwin: I was cruel to them.
Daniel Baldwin: I took advantage of them, took the drugs they needed for myself.
Daniel Baldwin: I certainly don't merit sympathy.
Daniel Baldwin: I shouldn't have come here.
Daniel Baldwin: Yet, in a way, this feels like justice.
He coughs up blood.
And then, silence.
After a while, the footman returns with the others.
By the time they get here, it's too late.
Doctor Baldwin has bled out, and he is lying lifeless in the forest.
Everything happened so quickly; it's all a blur.
After the screaming and crying in the woods, Captain Sinha took charge.
He had us carry the doctor on a makeshift stretcher.
It took a while, but we eventually reached the mansion.
Amelia Baxter: Oh my God! What happened!?
Amelia Baxter: Is that Doctor Baldwin? Is he injured?
Amelia Baxter: Oh no! Is he... dead?
Sushil Sinha: I'm sorry, dear, but he is.
Amelia Baxter: But... what happened?
Sushil Sinha: It was an accident.
Samuel Manning: I swear it was! I have no idea how I could have hit him.
Samuel Manning: I was aiming at a rabbit. I didn't even see him.
Everyone turns to him.
Amelia Baxter: You fool! You were probably too drunk, and that's why you hit him.
Amelia Baxter: You could barely walk this morning. Who gave you a gun?
Sushil Sinha: Please, there's no need to point fingers now. It's done.
Sushil Sinha: The police will handle it.
Sushil Sinha: Speaking of which, has anyone from the city arrived yet?
Amelia Baxter: No, not yet.
Amelia Baxter: We're still waiting for them.
Sushil Sinha: We should tell them to hurry.
Sushil Sinha: Lady Claythorn, where's the phone?
Lady Claythorn: I'll handle it.
She leaves the group, with the butler following closely behind.
The room falls silent.
Most eyes are on Sam Manning, filled with disdain.
Then, the hostess returns.
Lady Claythorn: I just spoke with the police. They aren't coming today.
Sushil Sinha: What!? Why not?
Lady Claythorn: They were on their way but encountered a huge tree blocking the road.
Lady Claythorn: They couldn't get past it.
Lady Claythorn: They said they'll be back tomorrow with assistance.
Amelia Baxter: But... what are we going to do with him until then?
Sushil Sinha: We'll move him to his bed for now.
Sushil Sinha: It's the best we can do under the circumstances.
Sushil Sinha: Anyone willing to help?
Ted Harring: I will.
We carried Doctor Baldwin to his room and laid him on his bed.
Sushil then covered him with a blanket.
Sushil Sinha: It's the best we can do at the moment.
Sushil Sinha: We shouldn't linger here.
Sushil Sinha: I want to keep an eye on Samuel Manning.
Ted Harring: Of course.
Sushil Sinha: Also Mr Harring, you might want to change before rejoining us.
I glance at my clothes.
They're stained with blood.
He is right, I can't go back downstairs looking like this.
So, I retreated to my room to fetch clean clothes.
I also took the opportunity to have a bath.
As I was preparing to go downstairs again, someone knocked on my door.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, may I come in?
Amelia Baxter... What does she want?
Ted Harring: Come on in, Mrs. Baxter. The door is open.
Amelia Baxter: I'm sorry to intrude, but I believe we should talk.
She doesn't wait for an answer and begins explaining.
Amelia Baxter: Something dangerous is happening here.
Ted Harring: What do you mean?
Amelia Baxter: Don't you find it strange that two different people died in the same place, from two different causes?
Ted Harring: Well, I don't know about Thomas Moody.
Ted Harring: But for the doctor's death, you said it yourself: Samuel Manning was probably drunk.
Ted Harring: That's tragic, but not really surprising.
Amelia Baxter: That's what I initially thought.
Amelia Baxter: However, I just spoke with the butler. He insisted that Samuel Manning was clear-minded when he handed him his gun.
Ted Harring: So, what, you think he staged the accident?
Ted Harring: He might've just drank too much during the hunt.
Amelia Baxter: Possibly, but it's still suspicious.
Amelia Baxter: I have other reasons to believe something is amiss here.
Amelia Baxter: Let's just say, I have a feeling.
Ted Harring: You can "feel" it?
Amelia Baxter: Don't dismiss what you don't understand, Mr Harring.
Amelia Baxter: But it's okay. I don't need you to believe me.
Amelia Baxter: I'm simply warning you to be cautious.
Ted Harring: Are you scared of Samuel Manning?
Amelia Baxter: Yes, but not just him.
Amelia Baxter: Others might be involved too.
Amelia Baxter: I don't think we can trust anyone fully.
Ted Harring: Yet, you seem to trust me.
Amelia Baxter: Well, I wouldn't put it that way.
Amelia Baxter: If someone were after me, I'd be defenseless. So, I need an ally.
Amelia Baxter: You seem capable of defending both of us if there's a direct confrontation.
Amelia Baxter: So, I chose to confide in you.
I'm at a loss for words.
A murder?
She is probably paranoid.
But still...
The gong sounds.
Everything that happened didn't disturbed the order of the house, it seems.
Amelia Baxter: It is dinner time.
Amelia Baxter: Not that I'm particularly hungry.
Amelia Baxter: But we should head downstairs regardless.
I nod in agreement.
Amelia Baxter: I believe we should continue this conversation later.
Amelia Baxter: If you agree, come see me in my room after dinner.
Amelia Baxter: I'm in the "Elizabeth I" room.
As I enter the room, the atmosphere is gloomy.
The seats of Daniel Baldwin and Thomas Moody are empty.
Samuel Manning is also absent.
I take my usual seat, with only Amelia Baxter beside me now.
Lady Claythorn starts a speech.
Lady Claythorn: Now that everyone is here, I want to express my deepest regret for what happened today.
Lady Claythorn: This isn't how I imagined our weekend.
Lady Claythorn: I don't believe any of us are in the mood for more entertainment.
Lady Claythorn: So, tomorrow morning, you'll receive your rewards.
Lady Claythorn: Afterward, we'll wait for the police to arrive.
Lady Claythorn: You're free to head home as soon as the officers give the all-clear.
Lady Claythorn: For now, enjoy your dinner.
Lady Claythorn: Drinks will be available in the billiard room afterwards, as they were yesterday.
The food is served shortly after the speech.
Yet, most of us have little appetite.
Ted Harring: Miss Baxter, I don't see Samuel Manning.
Ted Harring: Do you know where he might be?
Amelia Baxter: He's locked in his room.
Amelia Baxter: After you left, there was a debate about how to handle him.
Amelia Baxter: Ultimately, we decided it best to confine him to his room.
Amelia Baxter: He didn't resist.
Amelia Baxter: That's where he is now.
Amelia Baxter: It was agreed that his dinner would be served there.
Well, that's one less thing to worry about.
No one seems up for small talk.
Dinner passes in silence.
Most guests retire to their rooms after eating.
Given the day's events, I doubt many are in the mood for drinks.
What should I do next?
Map Choice: Garage
I was on my way to the basement when a young maid stopped me.
Young woman: Hello Sir, may I help you?
Ted Harring: Oh, don't mind me. I'm just taking a look around.
Young woman: I'm sorry, but the basement is off-limits to guests.
Young woman: However, there are plenty of rooms upstairs that you can explore.
Ted Harring: Of course, thank you.
Map Choice: Edward II Bedroom
I didn't have time earlier to take a good look at the room.
It feels a little weird being in here, but I might as well look for something useful.
I search his personal effects when I stumble upon his medication suitcase.
There's nothing out of the ordinary in there.
A stethoscope, bandages, a few bottles of medication,...
There's one in particular that he has more of than the others.
"Laudanum" is written on the label.
He has almost a dozen of those bottles.
Laudanum... I've heard of that before.
It's essentially opium.
It looks like the doctor wasn't using it only on patients.
Just in case, I might as well take a few for myself.
Map Choice: George IV Bedroom
I knock on the door.
Samuel Manning: Grrr, Mrrrr, Errrr
I can hear Samuel Manning's voice, but it's incoherent and he's mostly just moaning.
It's pretty clear that he's blind drunk.
I know that the door is closed, so there's no point in trying to enter.
Map Choice: Richard III Bedroom
The poor man is still there. I don't think he's moved.
Now that I'm here, perhaps I should take a quick look.
There might be something that helps me understand what happened.
I look around the room.
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
He looks peaceful.
His mask is still on.
The doctor didn't even remove it for the examination.
Well, if the doctor didn't, I certainly won't either.
On a chair next to the bed, his clothes are meticulously folded.
There's a whisky flask on the nightstand.
It's on its side, empty.
Next to it is a stain.
I suppose it's whisky, but it's an odd shade of green.
That's peculiar.
What could it be?
That's all I notice in the room.
Map Choice: Queen Alexandra
I knock on the door.
A low voice answers.
Rosalind Marsh: Yes? What is it?
Ted Harring: Miss Marsh, it's Ted Harring.
Ted Harring: I was wondering if we could talk.
Rosalind Marsh: It's incredibly late, Mr Harring.
Rosalind Marsh: Can't it wait until the morning?
Ted Harring: Yes, of course, sorry for disturbing you.
Map Choice: Henry IV Bedroom
I knock on the door.
Nobody answers.
Should I try to enter anyway?
No, that's probably a bad idea.
Everyone is in the house now, so it would be too risky.
Map Choice: George I Bedroom
I knock on the door.
Nobody answers.
Should I try to enter anyway?
No, that's probably a bad idea.
Everyone is in the house now, so it would be too risky.
Map Choice: Have a talk with Amelia Baxter
Ted Harring: Miss Baxter?
Ted Harring: Are you here? It's Ted Harring.
She slightly opens the door and looks in the hallway.
She seems worried.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, are you alone?
Ted Harring: I am.
Amelia Baxter: Come on in then.
Amelia Baxter: So, have you given any thought to what I told you?
Amelia Baxter: Do you agree that something isn't right?
Menu Choice: Admit she might be right
Ted Harring: I'm not sure yet. But what happened is strange enough that we should take some precautions.
Amelia Baxter: I'm glad you agree.
Amelia Baxter: I've given this a lot of thought, and I believe if what I fear is true, Samuel Manning had help from someone else.
Ted Harring: Do you mean a guest? Or could someone from the staff be involved?
Amelia Baxter: I wouldn't rule anything out, but it seems less likely that the staff or Lady Claythorn would be implicated.
Amelia Baxter: Such an act would require a massive operation.
Amelia Baxter: No, a more plausible theory is that one or two individuals heard about the event and took the places of real guests to infiltrate the manor.
Ted Harring: But why would they do that?
Amelia Baxter: Well, it's rather obvious, isn't it?
Amelia Baxter: The prize money, of course.
Amelia Baxter: It was mentioned in the invitation letter that the prize will be given in bearer's bonds.
Ted Harring: Bearer's bonds?
Amelia Baxter: That's a note that you can exchange at the bank without having to prove your identity.
Amelia Baxter: So, it's almost as easy to use as cash.
Ted Harring: That's a lot of money hidden somewhere in the manor.
Ted Harring: So you think it could be a mere robbery?
Ted Harring: Why not just directly attack the manor?
Amelia Baxter: It's easier to enter incognito.
Amelia Baxter: First, observe and then discreetly eliminate potential threats.
Amelia Baxter: That's the most likely explanation I could think of.
Ted Harring: I suppose that's possible.
Ted Harring: But there's no way to determine who might be involved.
Amelia Baxter: Exactly.
Amelia Baxter: That's why I suggest we stay safely in our rooms tonight.
Amelia Baxter: Tomorrow morning, the first one of us to wake up should alert the other.
Amelia Baxter: Then we stick together the entire day until we can safely leave.
Amelia Baxter: What do you think?
Ted Harring: It sounds like a good plan.
Ted Harring: Let's do it.
Amelia Baxter: Great!
Amelia Baxter: Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
Ted Harring: I think I should keep looking around the manor. I might learn something useful.
Amelia Baxter: It's not a bad idea. I will stay here tonight if you don't mind.
Amelia Baxter: Good luck.
Ted Harring: Thanks.
Wandering through this house has taken its toll.
And with everything that happened today, I'm drained.
I should go back to my room.
Before trying to sleep, it seems a good idea to barricade the door with some furniture.
You can't be too cautious.
That should be enough.
Now, I can rest peacefully.
I am awaken by the sound of frantic knocking at the door.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, are you there?
Miss Baxter?
Right, we agreed to wake each other up.
I just didn't expect it to be this early.
Ted Harring: I'm coming!
I quickly get dressed and open the door.
Amelia Baxter enters, looking visibly nervous.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Haring, I believe my hunch was right yesterday.
Amelia Baxter: Something strange is afoot.
Ted Harring: What do you mean?
Amelia Baxter: I haven't seen any staff members on my way here.
Amelia Baxter: At this hour, they should be busy with lighting fires, cleaning and setting up breakfast.
Amelia Baxter: Yet, I neither saw nor heard anyone.
Amelia Baxter: It's as silent as a graveyard in here.
Ted Harring: Are you sure it's not just because it's so early?
Amelia Baxter: I'm certain.
Amelia Baxter: I was up at the same time yesterday, and the house was bustling with activity.
Amelia Baxter: Something's not right, I assure you.
Ted Harring: Okay, if you say so.
Ted Harring: But how is that related to a robbery?
Amelia Baxter: I'm not so sure anymore that this is about a robbery.
Amelia Baxter: I have a feeling it could be something much worse.
A chill goes through my body.
Worse than a robbery? What could she mean?
But I'm hesitant to ask her.
Instead, I try to appear confident.
Ted Harring: Alright, we'd better investigate then.
Map Choice: George I Bedroom
Ted Harring: I knock on the door.
Ted Harring: There's no response.
Before I can say anything, Amelia is already trying the handle.
Amelia Baxter: It's locked.
Amelia Baxter: I believe this is Captain Sinha's room.
Ted Harring: He doesn't seem to be here.
Amelia Baxter: We should continue our search elsewhere.
Map Choice: Kitchen
I take the stairs to the basement, expecting to be stopped at any moment.
But no one is there.
I can safely explore downstairs now.
I reach the kitchen.
I guess it's a typical kitchen for a house of this size.
Pots and pans are scattered around.
Amelia Baxter: You see?
Amelia Baxter: No one is here.
Amelia Baxter: And yet, breakfast should be ready soon.
Ted Harring: Ok, I admit that is very strange indeed.
We look around a bit but don't find anything of interest.
Map Choice: Scullery
Ted Harring: Do you know what room this is?
Amelia Baxter: The scullery.
Wait, what the hell is a scullery?
Miss Baxter must have noticed my puzzled look, because she went on explaining.
Amelia Baxter: It's primarily where they wash dishes.
Amelia Baxter: If you look in the sink, there are a lot of dirty dishes.
Amelia Baxter: It seems nobody cleaned up after supper yesterday.
Right.
It's empty anyway, no need to linger here.
Map Choice: Gun room
The gun room is a bit intimidating.
So much firepower for just one household.
It makes me uneasy.
Ted Harring: Nobody is here.
Amelia Baxter: No, indeed.
Amelia Baxter: But don't you think it might be useful to get a weapon for protection?
Well, I don't have much experience with guns.
It might be a bad idea.
But then again, I don't know what we might encounter today.
Menu Choice: Take the gun. It doesn't matter that I don't know how to use it
Ted Harring: You are right.
Ted Harring: We should get something to defend ourselves.
The hunting rifles are a bit too large.
But I spot a revolver that fits my pocket.
Ted Harring: Alright, I'll take this with me.
Ted Harring: However, there are no bullets in it.
Amelia Baxter: Sometimes, bullets are kept separate from the guns.
Amelia Baxter: It reduces the likelihood of accidents.
Ted Harring: So, where could they be?
Amelia Baxter: I have no idea.
Amelia Baxter: Will you still take it?
Ted Harring: I think so, even an empty gun can still scare someone away.
Amelia Baxter: I suppose.
She doesn't look very convinced.
I pocket the gun anyway.
Map Choice: Garage
The garage.
This is where Lady Claythorn's car should be.
But instead, there are only parts of other cars and an old model in a shabby state.
Ted Harring: Did you come here in this car?
Amelia Baxter: No, of course not.
Amelia Baxter: Lady Claythorn's chauffeur drove us here in a Rolls Royce.
Amelia Baxter: Not in this old thing.
Ted Harring: Me neither.
Ted Harring: But if everyone has left, we might need it to reach the next town.
Amelia Baxter: Right. But do you know how to drive it?
Amelia Baxter: Because I surely can't.
Ted Harring: Not really, no.
Ted Harring: I never learned how to drive.
It's not like I could afford a car anyway.
Map Choice: Billiard room
The billiard room is empty.
But the drinks remain untouched.
Perhaps I should have a drink to calm my nerves.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, you aren't considering drinking at this hour, are you?
Ted Harring: Uh, no, of course not.
That's probably wiser.
Let's explore further.
Map Choice: Tea room
Here I am, back in the first room I visited in the manor.
All the liveliness of that first day is gone.
Now, it stands silent and empty.
Amelia Baxter: There's no one in here.
Amelia Baxter: Let's look elsewhere.
Ted Harring: Right, of course.
Map Choice: Entrance Hall
The entrance hall is usually the heart of the house.
But there's no activity today.
Just in case, I try to call out for someone.
Ted Harring: Is anyone here?
I didn't really expect an answer.
But an authoritative voice echoes from up the stairs.
Sushil Sinha: Who goes there?
Ted Harring: It's Ted Harring. I'm down here, and Amelia Baxter's with me.
Sushil Sinha: Understood. I'm on my way down.
Soon enough, Captain Sinha comes into view, descending the staircase to join us on the ground floor.
Sushil Sinha: At last, living, breathing souls.
Sushil Sinha: I was starting to feel like I was in a ghost house.
Amelia Baxter: We feel the same. You're the first person we've encountered today as well.
Ted Harring: Do you have any idea what's going on?
Sushil Sinha: Nothing concrete. All I know is, I don't like it.
Sushil Sinha: People don't just vanish from their homes without reason.
Amelia Baxter: They certainly don't.
Sushil Sinha: And then there's the matter of the suspicious deaths.
Sushil Sinha: I could've dismissed them as bad luck yesterday, but now... I'm not so certain.
The conversation lingers in the air, a heavy silence stretching between us.
Amelia Baxter: Staying put won't give us any answers.
Amelia Baxter: We need to continue exploring the house.
Sushil Sinha: Agreed. Should we search together?
Amelia Baxter: Thank you, but... maybe it's better to split up.
Amelia Baxter: We'd cover more ground that way.
Amelia seemed nervous when she answered.
Sushil Sinha: Makes sense. Let's proceed on our own and regroup later.
Sushil Sinha: How about the tea room?
Amelia Baxter: That sounds good.
Amelia Baxter: See you there.
Map Choice: Garden
We venture out to explore the garden.
But there's no trace of anyone.
Lady Claythorn's car isn't there either.
I try shouting to attract attention.
Ted Harring: Hello! Is anyone here?
Ted Harring: Hello!!
No response.
Amelia Baxter: I don't think shouting will help.
Amelia Baxter: If someone's here, we'll find them.
Oh, was shouting inappropriate?
I guess she'll always prioritize decorum, no matter the situation.
Let's head back inside then.
Map Choice: Queen Alexandra
Amelia Baxter: This is Miss Marsh's room.
I knock on the door.
There's no response.
Amelia Baxter: There's no need for formalities now.
Amelia Baxter: We should just enter.
Before I can react, she tries to open the door.
Amelia Baxter: It's locked.
Amelia Baxter: She must have gone out.
Amelia Baxter: Let's try somewhere else.
Map Choice: Richard III Bedroom
I'm in Thomas Moody's room.
He is still lying on the bed.
I see no one else around.
I should move on.
Map Choice: Edward II Bedroom
I'm back in Daniel Baldwin's room.
His lifeless body still lies on the bed.
Aside from that, everything seems in order.
I don't wish to linger here any longer than necessary.
Map Choice: George IV Bedroom
Amelia Baxter: This is Samuel Manning's room.
Ted Harring: Mr Manning?
Ted Harring: Are you in there?
No answer.
Ted Harring: The door's locked anyway.
Ted Harring: Mr Sinha has the key.
I doubt we'll find anyone now.
So we settled in the tea room to wait for Captain Sinha.
Sushil Sinha: It's unbelievable, but it seems we're the only three living souls left here.
Sushil Sinha: Did you find anything?
Ted Harring: Nothing.
Ted Harring: It seems everyone is gone.
Ted Harring: Except for the bodies.
Ted Harring: By the way, did you check on Samuel Manning?
Ted Harring: You're the only one with the key to his room.
Sushil Sinha: No, not yet. I assumed he couldn't have gone far.
Sushil Sinha: But you're right, we should check on him.
Ted Harring: I think so too.
Ted Harring: We'll follow you.
Amelia shoots me a concerned look but remains silent.
She follows us nonetheless.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Manning, are you there?
No response.
Sushil Sinha: Alright, I'm going in.
He unlocks the door, and we trail behind him.
But as I step inside, Captain Sinha tries to halt us.
Sushil Sinha: Wait! Don't come in.
But it's already too late.
The sight inside is beyond horrifying.
Samuel Manning lies in his bed, drenched in blood, his throat slashed multiple times.
Pale as a sheet, his eyes frozen in a blank stare.
Miss Baxter almost screams.
Sushil Sinha: Miss Baxter, please don't stay here.
She's speechless, her gaze fixed on the horrifying scene.
Sushil Sinha gently pulls her arm, leading her out. I quickly follow.
Sushil Sinha: I regret letting you see that.
Sushil Sinha: You shouldn't have entered.
Amelia Baxter: Is... is he... dead?
Sushil Sinha: I'm afraid so.
Ted Harring: Are you certain?
Ted Harring: Shouldn't we check his pulse?
Ted Harring: Maybe... just maybe, there's a chance he's alive.
My voice trembles as I speak, realisation dawning on me.
Sushil Sinha: I'm sorry, but it's too late.
Sushil Sinha: I've seen enough dead people to know. He's been gone for a long time.
Sushil Sinha: Likely since last night.
Amelia Baxter: Oh my God.
The weight of shock renders me motionless.
To help us recover, Sushil guides us back to the tea room.
Sushil Sinha: Miss Baxter, you should probably rest here for a little bit.
Sushil Sinha: I have something to check out, and I'll be back soon.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Harring, would you mind coming with me?
I'm still shaken from what we saw, but doing something might help me recover my senses.
Ted Harring: Well, sure.
Ted Harring: I'll follow you.
Amelia Baxter: Please don't be long.
Sushil Sinha: Don't worry, this should only take a few minutes.
He walks back up the stairs and stands in front of another room.
Sushil Sinha: It's Miss Marsh's room.
Sushil Sinha: When I tried the handle earlier it was locked.
Sushil Sinha: At the time, I didn't dare to go further.
Sushil Sinha: But now, I fear we may have no choice.
Ted Harring: Do you believe she might still be inside?
Ted Harring: Then she would be...
Sushil Sinha: Dead, I am afraid.
Sushil Sinha: After what we witnessed, I think it a very strong possibility.
Ted Harring: Oh my God.
Sushil Sinha: There is no need to break the door.
Sushil Sinha: The butler entrusted me with a master key when we confined Mr Manning.
Sushil Sinha: It should open every room in the house.
He has a master key?
That mean he is able to visit every room of this place.
Captain Sinha then slips a small key from his pocket.
With a steady hand he turns the lock.
The mechanism clicks, and the door swings open into the silence beyond.
The room is eerily quiet.
But Rosalind Marsh is not there.
We look in every corner, but we can't find anything of interest.
Ted Harring: What a relief.
Sushil Sinha: Yes, of course. But there's no need to linger here.
Sushil Sinha: Let's return to the tea room, we need to talk with Miss Baxter to decide our next steps.
Amelia Baxter: You've been gone for a while. What happened?
Sushil Sinha: I'm afraid we haven't been able to find Miss Marsh.
Sushil Sinha: Her room was locked, so we forced it open.
Sushil Sinha: But it was all for naught, as it was empty.
Amelia Baxter: Well, what should we do now?
Sushil Sinha: You both seem a bit shaken up.
Sushil Sinha: That's not surprising, given what you've witnessed.
Sushil Sinha: It's easier for me.
Sushil Sinha: Sadly, I've seen my share of dead people.
Sushil Sinha: So I suggest you two rest for a bit while I continue to explore the manor.
Sushil Sinha: I'll be back soon.
I feel like I should accompany him.
But he is right, I am exhausted and overwhelmed.
So I just agree with a nod and sit down.
We stayed in the tea room and gathered our strength while Sushil Sinha kept searching the manor.
When he returned, we had started to feel a bit better.
Sushil Sinha: I believe I've looked absolutely everywhere now.
Sushil Sinha: There is no trace of anyone.
Sushil Sinha: I also tried to use the telephone, and it's not working.
Sushil Sinha: Thus, there is no way for us to call for help.
Sushil Sinha: The way I see it now, we don't have many options left.
Sushil Sinha: I believe we must leave this place.
Sushil Sinha: The longer we stay, the more at risk we are.
Amelia Baxter: But... shouldn't we wait for the police?
Amelia Baxter: They were expected today. They could arrive any moment.
Sushil Sinha: I wouldn't count on it.
Sushil Sinha: From what I gather, there's no evidence that the police were called yesterday.
Amelia Baxter: But Miss Claythorn said...
Amelia Baxter: She said...
She stops mid-sentence, realising the implication.
Amelia Baxter: I see, you believe she never called.
Amelia Baxter: That the police have no idea about what's happened here.
Amelia Baxter: That she lied to us.
Sushil Sinha: That's the most logical explanation.
Sushil Sinha: No one was around when the phone calls were supposedly made.
Sushil Sinha: So, there's no way to verify if they actually happened.
Ted Harring: But why?
Ted Harring: Why would anyone do this?
Ted Harring: I don't understand what's happening.
Sushil Sinha: Neither do I.
Sushil Sinha: I've thought about it, and I have no clue why we were all invited here.
Sushil Sinha: I'm certain it wasn't to give us any money.
Sushil Sinha: In any case, all I know is we need to leave as soon as possible.
Amelia Baxter: But how could we leave?
Amelia Baxter: The nearest town is miles away.
Amelia Baxter: I can't walk that far.
Amelia Baxter: And even if I could, I'm not prepared for such a journey.
Captain Sinha and I consider this for a moment.
Sushil Sinha: You might be right.
Sushil Sinha: It would be a long walk, and the weather might turn at any moment.
Sushil Sinha: We could get caught in another storm.
Sushil Sinha: It's probably unsafe for you to join us.
Amelia Baxter: But you're not going to leave me here alone, are you?
Amelia Baxter: What would become of me?
Sushil Sinha: We could lock you in a room.
Sushil Sinha: Though, that's far from ideal.
Sushil Sinha: Perhaps one of us should stay with you.
Amelia Baxter: Yes!
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring can stay with me, right?
Amelia Baxter: The two of us should be safe until you return with help.
Sushil Sinha: That seems to be the wisest choice.
Sushil Sinha: What do you think, Mr Harring?
Menu Choice: Stay here with Amelia Baxter
I don't feel comfortable leaving Amelia Baxter alone here.
And in any case, I don't like the idea of being alone with this guy in the forest.
For all we know, he might very well be the killer.
Miss Baxter doesn't seem to trust him either.
So I figure it's best for us to stay here and be on our guard.
If we're lucky, the captain will return with reinforcements, and everything will be fine.
Ted Harring: I think I should stay here.
Amelia Baxter: Yes! Thank you, Mr Harring.
Sushil Sinha: It's decided then, I'll go alone.
Sushil Sinha: And there is no time to lose, so I better leave immediately.
Amelia Baxter: Good thinking. And don't worry about us, we'll be fine here.
Amelia Baxter: Be careful.
Ted Harring: Good luck, Captain.
Sushil Sinha: Thank you both. I will be back soon.
We watched him leave the room, and I can sense relief in Miss Baxter's eyes.
As soon as Captain Sinha is out of sight, she stands up.
Amelia Baxter: Well, there's no point in waiting around doing nothing.
Amelia Baxter: We haven't eaten since yesterday.
Amelia Baxter: I could check the kitchen to see if there's anything I can prepare.
Ted Harring: Okay, I'll come with you.
We were heading to the lower floor when we heard a shout.
Rosalind Marsh: Hello!
Rosalind Marsh: Is there someone here?
Amelia Baxter: Oh my God, Miss Marsh, you're here!
Rosalind Marsh: Of course I am here. Why do you look so surprised?
Rosalind Marsh: I'm afraid I overslept. I don't feel quite like myself today.
Rosalind Marsh: When I woke up, I went to check the dining room but found it empty.
Rosalind Marsh: I wandered in the house for a while but I didn't see anyone until I met you.
Rosalind Marsh: Where is everybody?
Amelia Baxter: Oh my dear, we don't know.
We updated her on what happened since this morning.
When we had finished telling her the story, she remained relatively calm, considering the situation.
Rosalind Marsh: Poor Mr Manning, what a terrible fate.
Rosalind Marsh: And what horror that must have been for you, my dear.
Rosalind Marsh: Are you all right?
Amelia Baxter: I am better now.
Amelia Baxter: Captain Sinha should be back with help soon, so I'll be fine if I can keep my mind occupied until then.
Amelia Baxter: Speaking of which, we were heading to the kitchen to see if we can prepare some sort of meal.
Rosalind Marsh: Right, it's a good idea. We might as well keep ourselves busy.
And just like that, we headed downstairs to the kitchen.
We look around for something to eat.
Amelia Baxter: There isn't much.
Amelia Baxter: But I think we can manage a light luncheon if you're not picky.
Rosalind Marsh: I'll help you.
I offer to help as well, but they decline.
So, I take a seat while they prepare the food.
That's probably for the best.
I couldn't do much to help anyway.
When everything is ready, I carry the plates to the dining room.
I set them at our usual places.
Then I leave the dining room.
Amelia Baxter: Where are you going, Mr Harring?
Amelia Baxter: It's better if we stick together at all times.
Ted Harring: I understand, but there's something I need to do alone.
Ted Harring: We haven't had a moment apart the entire day and...
Amelia Baxter: Say no more, I understand.
Amelia Baxter: I'm in the same situation.
Amelia Baxter: What about you, Miss Marsh?
Rosalind Marsh: Oh, I'm fine, thank you.
Rosalind Marsh: You both go, I'll finish preparing the table.
Amelia Baxter: Very well.
Amelia Baxter: Let's meet back here in a few minutes then.
Ted Harring: Of course.
I accompany Miss Baxter to her room.
Amelia Baxter: This is where we part.
Amelia Baxter: We'll meet again in the dining room in a few minutes.
Ted Harring: Alright, see you soon.
I see her enter her room, but as I'm about to leave for mine, a strange feeling overwhelms me.
Something tells me not to go to my room.
That I should return to the dining room immediately.
What should I do?
Menu Choice: Hold it in and go back downstairs{{intuition}}
Instead of going to my room, I go down the stairs and return to the dining room.
When I return, I see Miss Marsh with my plate in her hands.
Ted Harring: Wait, what are you doing?
She jumps up, visibly startled.
Rosalind Marsh: Oh, nothing special. I just realised the plate set out for me is too full.
Rosalind Marsh: I won't be able to eat that much.
Rosalind Marsh: But you are a strong gentleman.
Rosalind Marsh: I am sure you won't mind switching with me, right?
Ted Harring: I actually do mind.
Ted Harring: Not the quantity, but I have already seasoned my plate exactly how I like it.
Ted Harring: I would prefer to keep it that way.
It's not a likely lie, but she doesn't have a response to it.
She hesitates for a moment.
Rosalind Marsh: All right then. I'll swap with Miss Baxter instead.
Rosalind Marsh: I'm certain she won't mind.
Something bothers me about this.
But I can't quite figure out what it is.
She's so quick to exchange the plates that I don't have time to raise an objection anyway.
When Miss Baxter comes back, we start eating in silence.
After finishing, I rise and offer to wash the dishes.
Amelia Baxter: No, don't worry. I'll handle it.
She stands but appears slightly off-balance.
Amelia Baxter: I feel faint...
Suddenly, she collapses.
Amelia Baxter: What is happening?
Amelia Baxter: This doesn't make any sense.
Amelia Baxter: I thought I...
I rush to her side.
Ted Harring: Are you alright?
Ted Harring: Do you need a glass of water?
Amelia Baxter: No no, I don't need anything thank you.
Her expression subtly changes, from fright to resignation.
Amelia Baxter: I feel... I feel I made a huge mistake.
Ted Harring: What do you mean?
Amelia Baxter: It doesn't matter now.
Amelia Baxter: It's too late.
Amelia Baxter: I am sorry, I shouldn't have lied.
Ted Harring: What are you talking about? Lie about what?
Amelia Baxter: About everything.
Amelia Baxter: That... I was never a psychic...
Amelia Baxter: I am... a fraud...
Amelia Baxter: A con artist...
Amelia Baxter: I...
Ted Harring: Don't say anything, you need to keep your strength.
Amelia Baxter: No it's too late for that.
Amelia Baxter: I need to... now...
Amelia Baxter: I...
Amelia Baxter: I...
She can't finish her sentence.
As I watch Amelia Baxter's life slowing leaving her body,
I turn towards Rosalind Marsh.
Ted Harring: Oh my God!
Ted Harring: What have you done?
Rosalind Marsh: Nothing! I swear, I was just...
Rosalind Marsh: trying to...
Ted Harring: Don't try to lie to me.
Ted Harring: I saw you swapping plates. What kind of poison did you put in there?
Rosalind Marsh: Nothing, you don't understand.
Rosalind Marsh: That means 'my' plate was poisoned.
I am startled for a moment by that response.
Then I think, wait, what about my plate then...
Have I eaten the same thing as her?
Now that I think about it, I realize I am suddenly very tired.
Ted Harring: God, you also poisoned me, didn't you?
Rosalind Marsh: No! I swear.
My vision is getting blurry.
I am in danger here.
Rosalind Marsh: Mr Harring, are you all right?
Rosalind Marsh: You look unwell.
She slowly approaches me.
Ted Harring: Stay where you are!
Ted Harring: Don't come any closer.
I point the gun at her.
It's empty, but she doesn't know that.
Ted Harring: Move back, or I'll shoot!
It seems to work. She jumps back.
Rosalind Marsh: Don't shoot! Please, I won't move.
Rosalind Marsh: I swear.
I'm not safe here.
I need to move.
Gathering all my strength, I rush to the main staircase.
I sprint to the entrance hall and make a break for the door.
It's locked.
How can this be?
My strength is fading slowly.
I must do something.
So, with the last of my energy, I go up the stairs and head to my room.
Once inside, I slam the door shut.
Panic floods my mind.
I can't stay here.
She likely has a key.
And I'm on the verge of passing out.
I need an escape route.
My eyes fix on the window.
This bedroom is not too high.
I might be able to climb down safely.
I throw open the window.
Thankfully, it isn't locked.
Below, there is a picket fence.
But if I can guide my descent, I might avoid it.
I just need to...
She's right outside.
Time is running out.
Gripping the window sill, I prepare to jump.
If I can control my fall, maybe I can...
You fell.
Right onto the picket fence.
An iron pole pierced through your belly.
You didn't stand a chance.
But you were so close to escaping.
It must be incredibly frustrating.
You'll need to be more cautious next time.

This invitation really isn't well written.
Vague instructions on how to reach the manor.
There's little information about who has been invited.
I suppose it wouldn't be surprising if some of the participants did not show up.
I cannot help feeling nervous about the whole thing.
Well, it's too late to turn back now.
We shall see what happens.
I step off the train and look around me.
On the platform, I spot a young man in a footman's livery.
He is talking to a tanned man with a serious expression.
I walk towards them.
Amelia Baxter: Excuse me, gentlemen. I'm heading to Claythorn Manor and was wondering if you could assist me.
Footman: Yes, of course. You must be Amelia Baxter.
Amelia Baxter: That's correct.
Footman: Perfect. I work for Lady Claythorn and have been instructed to take you to the manor.
Footman: The gentleman here is also coming with us.
Sushil Sinha: Nice to meet you, Miss Baxter.
He takes my hand and kisses it lightly.
At least here's someone with manners.
Amelia Baxter: How do you do, Mr ...
Sushil Sinha: Sinha, Sushil Sinha.
Amelia Baxter: Ah.
Amelia Baxter: Nice to meet you too, Mr Sinha.
Footman: I believe there's still someone on this train who is supposed to accompany us.
Footman: A Mr Manning.
Footman: Have either of you met him by any chance?
Sushil Sinha: I don't think so.
Amelia Baxter: Me neither.
Footman: Alright, maybe he missed it.
Footman: Let us wait a few minutes to be sure everyone has left this train, then we can move on.
As the train prepares to leave the station, I see someone stumbling out of a door, almost falling.
Since we're the only people left on the platform, he walks towards us, looking uncertain.
Footman: Hello, sir. Are you going to Claythorn Manor?
Samuel Manning: I am indeed.
Footman: Perfect, that should be everyone.
Footman: You can follow me to the car, and we'll be on our way.
Footman: It will take about an hour to reach the manor.
I take a seat in the back.
Sushil Sinha joins me.
Sushil Sinha: I hope you don't mind my sitting with you.
Sushil Sinha: I think it's better to let Mr Manning sit in front.
Amelia Baxter: Of course not.
I understand all too well what he means.
Samuel Manning seems quite out of sorts.
He attempts to make small talk with the driver, but his speech is incoherent.
The poor fellow does his best to ignore him and focus on the road.
When he realises no one wishes to talk to him, Samuel Manning takes a sip from a flask and immediately falls asleep in his seat.
The driver sighs with relief.
Sushil Sinha: Well, he's certainly had one too many.
Sushil Sinha: I hope he can sleep it off.
Sushil Sinha: It would be embarrassing for our host to greet him in this state.
Amelia Baxter: You are certainly right.
Amelia Baxter: I would rather discuss something else, if you do not mind.
Sushil Sinha: Not at all.
Menu Choice: Where are you from?
Sushil Sinha: I come directly from London.
Sushil Sinha: I have been living there for the last two decades.
Amelia Baxter: London.
Amelia Baxter: Right.
Amelia Baxter: But that's not what I meant.
Sushil Sinha: I am sorry, what did you mean?
Menu Choice: I mean, where are you "Really" from?
Sushil Sinha: Oh ... I was raised in Calcutta.
Sushil Sinha: But I've been living in England for so long that I don't even think about it anymore.
Amelia Baxter: Alright. Calcutta is in the far east, right?
Sushil Sinha: Yes, it's in North India.
Sushil Sinha: I was born there.
Sushil Sinha: Growing up, I was always fascinated by the stories of the Raj army and their brave officers.
Sushil Sinha: I knew from a young age that I wanted to join the army and serve my country.
Sushil Sinha: As I grew older, I began to prepare myself for the rigorous training that would be required to become an officer in the Raj army.
Sushil Sinha: I studied hard and practiced my shooting and horseback riding skills.
Sushil Sinha: I also learned about the history of India and the British Raj, so that I could understand the context of the conflicts that the army was involved in.
Sushil Sinha: Finally, in 1890, I was accepted into the Raj army as a cadet.
Sushil Sinha: The training was grueling, but I was determined to succeed.
Sushil Sinha: I was taught how to march, how to shoot, and how to lead my men in battle.
Sushil Sinha: I also learned about strategy and tactics, so that I could make quick decisions in the heat of battle.
Sushil Sinha: After two years of training, I was finally commissioned as an officer.
Sushil Sinha: I was assigned to a regiment and sent to the frontier, where I would be fighting against the tribes that were trying to rebel against the British Raj.
Sushil Sinha: It was a difficult and dangerous assignment, but I was determined to do my best.
Sushil Sinha: I led my men into battle and fought bravely, always thinking of the safety and well-being of my men.
Sushil Sinha: I was able to successfully quell the rebellion, and my men and I returned home as heroes.
Sushil Sinha: I continued to serve in the Raj army for many years, rising through the ranks and taking on more responsibility.
Sushil Sinha: As the years went by, I was increasingly exposed to the ways of the British army and began to adopt their techniques and strategies.
Sushil Sinha: I was eventually sent to London to train new officers, ...
My god, he is going to tell me his whole life story.
How rude.
And there is no way to avoid him here.
So I nod in assent and barely listens to what he is saying.
After what seems an eternity, the manor appears on the horizon.
That finally puts an end to Captain Sinha's monologue.
Sushil Sinha: Ah, it looks like we're arriving at our destination.
Sushil Sinha: What a magnificent home.
He's right, it is beautiful.
However, the storm lends it a somewhat sinister aspect.
Nevertheless, its appearance reassures me somewhat.
Such a house suggests its owner must be incredibly wealthy.
Everything ought to be fine from now on.
The three of us walk towards the entrance while the driver attends to our luggage.
Samuel Manning wakes up when the car stops. He looks somewhat better than before.
When we reach the main door, a butler greets us.
Butler: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Claythorn Manor.
Butler: I'm sorry that Lady Claythorn can't greet you herself.
Butler: She is still busy preparing for tonight.
Butler: In the meantime, you can enjoy some drinks in the tea room.
Butler: Or, if you wish to change, I can show you to your room right now.
Samuel Manning: I'm good, but I could use a drink.
Samuel Manning: Which way is the tea room?
Astonishing. He looked passed out drunk in the car.
How could he possibly want another drink now?
Butler: Very well, sir. You'll find the tea room through the door on your left.
Butler: Other guests who arrived earlier are already settled there.
Butler: You can join them.
Sushil Sinha: I'll come with you.
Butler: What about you, Miss ...?
Amelia Baxter: Miss Baxter.
Amelia Baxter: I believe I shall freshen up in my room first.
Amelia Baxter: It has been a very long journey.
Butler: Of course, please follow me upstairs.
Butler: Here we are, Miss.
Butler: The "Elizabeth I Bedroom."
Butler: I hope it's to your liking.
He opens my room and lets me in.
At the same time, the driver arrives with my luggage.
He leaves them there and then excuses himself.
Butler: Well, it looks like you're all set.
Butler: Please join us in the dining room when you're ready.
I nod and take a look at my room.
It is a bit worn, but it still looks decent.
I should be quite comfortable here.
When I am ready, I head downstairs to the tea room.
Butler: Miss Baxter.
Butler: Almost everyone is here now.
He quickly introduces me to those I have not yet met.
Butler: Please make yourself at home.
Butler: Now, if you'll excuse me, I hear the car is back with the last guest.
He leaves me on my own.
I glance about the room.
Nearly everyone is gathered around Sushil Sinha.
He is in the midst of what sounds like yet another tedious story.
I am not eager to listen to that again.
On a chair, Samuel Manning sits alone with a glass in his hand.
I can't believe it.
He fell asleep again.
Well, I suppose I have no choice but to join the larger group.
But before I can move, the butler returns.
Butler: Mr Ted Harring!
The butler nearly shouts the name of the new guest.
He is a good-looking young man, but he appears unsure.
It is clear he is not in his natural element here.
I smile at him and, after some hesitation, he comes towards me.
Ted Harring: Nice to meet you, Miss Baxter. I am Ted Harring.
Amelia Baxter: Nice to meet you, Mr Harring.
Menu Choice: Tell me more about yourself.
Ted Harring: There isn't much to say about me.
Ted Harring: I was born and raised in Birmingham.
Ted Harring: I work there as a business associate.
Amelia Baxter: Interesting, in what type of business?
Ted Harring: Well, just regular sales.
Amelia Baxter: And do you sell anything in particular?
Ted Harring: A bit of everything, depending on the opportunities.
Amelia Baxter: You don't have a store then?
Ted Harring: No, no, it's nothing like that.
He seems uneasy.
He is probably ashamed of what he is doing.
I shouldn't push him further.
Menu Choice: Why were you invited here?
Ted Harring: I was in the papers for rescuing a baby from a building on fire.
Ted Harring: It happened last year.
Amelia Baxter: How impressive! What I've done is nothing compared to that.
Amelia Baxter: Please tell me more about it.
Ted Harring: I don't know how impressive it really was.
Ted Harring: It was more a matter of being in the right place at the right moment.
Ted Harring: I was just going home one day, it was rather late.
Ted Harring: On my way, I happened to notice smoke coming from a house across the street.
Ted Harring: I was about to call for the firemen.
Ted Harring: But out of the window, I heard a baby screaming.
Ted Harring: I couldn't possibly stay there and do nothing.
Ted Harring: So without thinking about it, I forced the front door of the house and ran upstairs.
Ted Harring: A fire was spreading from one of the rooms.
Ted Harring: Luckily, the room with the baby was still safe.
Ted Harring: So I ran into it, grabbed the baby, and went downstairs as fast as I could.
Ted Harring: When I reached outside, I could hear the firemen on their way.
Ted Harring: The neighbors had already alerted them.
Ted Harring: As soon as they arrived, I gave them the baby.
Ted Harring: Reporters were with them.
Ted Harring: When they saw me, they decided it was a story worth printing.
Ted Harring: But it wasn't really. Anyone would have done the same.
Ted Harring: I think they just wanted to sell papers. So they exaggerated what I had done.
Ted Harring: And they also omitted the worst part.
Ted Harring: The baby wasn't alone in the house, of course.
Ted Harring: Why would they have been?
Ted Harring: The fire was caused by the nanny.
Ted Harring: She had an attack and dropped a lamp on the floor.
Ted Harring: That was her room that was on fire.
Ted Harring: I didn't even check there.
Ted Harring: So when the firemen arrived, it was too late.
Ted Harring: They said there was nothing I could have done, but I am not sure.
Amelia Baxter: Don't say that. I am certain it was too late for her.
Amelia Baxter: You did the only thing you could have done.
Amelia Baxter: You shouldn't blame yourself.
Ted Harring: I guess.
Ted Harring: But it's hard.
Ted Harring: I still have nightmares about it.
Amelia Baxter: ...
I don't know what to say here.
Butler: Dinner is served. Please follow me to the dining room.
I sit down at the place with my name on it.
Then, a lady enters the room.
She is wearing expensive clothing.
Lady Claythorn: Welcome, everyone. My apologies for keeping you waiting.
Lady Claythorn: Now that we're all gathered, I'd like to express my gratitude once more.
Lady Claythorn: As you already know, you are here because of the heroic acts you've committed in the past.
Lady Claythorn: I've taken notice of these actions and felt it was my responsibility to extend a formal 'thank you.'
Lady Claythorn: I realize the invitation letter you received was somewhat vague, so let me clarify its contents now.
Lady Claythorn: My first gift to you is a stay at my manor.
Lady Claythorn: You'll be fully catered to, enjoying the most refined food, expertly prepared by my personal chef.
Lady Claythorn: During the three days we'll spend together, we'll also partake in various activities, which I'm sure you'll find enjoyable.
Lady Claythorn: My second gift is a sum of one thousand pounds, to be shared among you.
Lady Claythorn: This is my way of thanking those as selfless as yourselves, who help others without thought of reward.
Following her speech, our host settles back down in her chair.
Well said.
I join in the applause with the rest of the guests.
Lady Claythorn: Please no need to thank me. The food will be served, enjoy your meal.
The food arrives right after the speech.
The timing is perfect.
It seems I already know the persons next to me.
On my left is Mr Sinha.
And Ted Harring is on my right.
Menu Choice: Talk to Ted Harring
Ted Harring: Hi again Miss Baxter.
Amelia Baxter: Oh Mr Harring. I am glad we can continue our conversation.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this place?
Ted Harring: It's very nice.
Ted Harring: It's a bit far from town, I think.
Ted Harring: But I suppose some people like the isolation.
Menu Choice: How old are you?
Ted Harring: I am 22 years old.
That make sense, but he somewhat looks older than that.
I guess it's his rugged look.
Life is not easy for the working class.
Menu Choice: What room are you in?
Ted Harring: I don't know, I haven't been to my room yet.
Ted Harring: I just arrived, and I didn't realize I would be the last one here.
Menu Choice: What do you think of the other guests?
Ted Harring: Well, I just arrived.
Ted Harring: So I don't really have an opinion on anyone yet.
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for him
Menu Choice: Talk to Sushil Sinha
Maybe I was too quick to judge him.
I should try to talk to him again.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Sinha.
Sushil Sinha: Miss Baxter.
Sushil Sinha: I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but I am the one on your left.
Sushil Sinha: You should have engaged in conversation with me first.
Amelia Baxter: Oh right, I am sorry.
What a stickler he is.
Also, how does he know this?
Menu Choice: Tell me more about yourself
Wait, why am I encouraging him?
Sushil Sinha: Oh, I thought I already said plenty in the car.
Sushil Sinha: But, if you insist of course.
Sushil Sinha: Where did we stop last time?
Sushil Sinha: Ah yes, I was telling you about the time I was sent to London.
Sushil Sinha: My mission there was to train new officers, a duty I regarded as both an honour and a burden.
Sushil Sinha: The young men were eager, full of fire, but they had little understanding of what it truly meant to lead others into danger.
Sushil Sinha: It was my task to temper their enthusiasm with discipline, to teach them not merely how to fight, but how to think, how to endure, and how to carry the weight of command.
Sushil Sinha: In those years I saw the very best and the very worst of human nature.
Sushil Sinha: Some rose splendidly to the challenge, others faltered and fell away.
Sushil Sinha: But I gave them all that I could, for I knew that the fate of many would one day rest upon their shoulders, just as it had once rested upon mine.
Sushil Sinha: When at last my service came to its end, I retired with a measure of pride, though also with a heavy heart.
Sushil Sinha: For the army had been my life, my purpose, and leaving it behind was no easy thing.
Sushil Sinha: Still, I hold no regrets. I served faithfully, and I did my duty, as any officer ought.
All right, I think I have heard his whole life story now.
Menu Choice: Why were you invited here?
Sushil Sinha: It is most likely because of my actions during the Great War.
Sushil Sinha: In particular, those in 1917, during the Mesopotamian campaign.
Sushil Sinha: Our regiment was tasked with taking control of a heavily fortified Turkish position.
Sushil Sinha: The battle was intense and brutal, with heavy gunfire and explosions all around us.
Sushil Sinha: I led my men through the chaos, urging them forward and providing cover fire.
Sushil Sinha: Despite the danger, we were able to push through the enemy lines and take control of the position.
Sushil Sinha: I was severely injured in the battle, but I refused to be taken off the field until the objective was secured.
Sushil Sinha: My actions, bravery and leadership inspired my men and led to the success of our mission.
Sushil Sinha: For my actions, I was awarded the Military Cross, one of the highest honors that can be given to an officer of the British army.
Sushil Sinha: I was proud to have served my country and to have played a role in the ultimate victory of the Great War.
Well, he certainly likes to tell a story in full.
That's my fault for asking.
The dinner is over.
The host gave us the opportunity to meet again for drinks.
But I do not know, this has been quite a long day.
Perhaps I should simply go to bed.
In any case, I ought to retire to my room first.
Well, I am comfortably settled.
What should I do now?
Map Choice: Queen Alexandra
I knock on the door, waiting for a response.
There's silence. No one replies.
I do not think it would be wise to simply enter someone's room like that.
They might return at any moment.
Map Choice: Meet the others in the billiard room
It appears that most guests have chosen to gather here.
Daniel Baldwin stands alone in the corner.
Ted Harring is at the bar with Samuel Manning.
A crowd has formed around Sushil Sinha.
He is likely monopolising the conversation.
Menu Choice: Talk to Daniel Baldwin
Amelia Baxter: Mr Baldwin, we have not been introduced yet.
Amelia Baxter: I am Amelia Baxter.
Daniel Baldwin: Pleased to meet you, Miss Baxter.
Menu Choice: Tell me more about yourself.
Daniel Baldwin: I am the chief physician at St. Margaret's Hospital.
Daniel Baldwin: It's a charity hospital for those in need.
Daniel Baldwin: Before that, I worked a bit all over the place.
Daniel Baldwin: I also served in the army several times, including the last one.
Daniel Baldwin: That one was the worst, of course.
Menu Choice: Why were you invited here?
Daniel Baldwin: Well, I recently celebrated my ten years at St. Margaret's.
Daniel Baldwin: Not many people stay that long at this type of institution.
Daniel Baldwin: Usually, doctors stay for a few years to build a reputation, then move on to a more luxurious practice.
Daniel Baldwin: Lady Claythorn must have understood the sacrifice I've made, hence the reward.
Daniel Baldwin: Not that I consider it a sacrifice, of course.
Daniel Baldwin: I love my job and wouldn't change it for the world.
Daniel Baldwin: Still, it's always nice to receive some recognition.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this place?
Daniel Baldwin: It's a nice house.
Daniel Baldwin: But I can't say much more about it.
Daniel Baldwin: I'm not used to visiting such places.
Daniel Baldwin: This is the first time I've been invited to a grand mansion as a guest and not as a doctor.
Daniel Baldwin: The truth is, my job doesn't pay that much.
Daniel Baldwin: Nevertheless, I'm content with my small apartment.
Daniel Baldwin: I wouldn't want anything this big; it must be such a hassle to manage.
Menu Choice: What room are you in?
Daniel Baldwin: I'm staying in the Edward II room.
Menu Choice: What do you think of the other guests?
Daniel Baldwin: Oh, I haven't talked to many people so far.
Daniel Baldwin: I think the only person I've heard speak is Mr Sinha.
Daniel Baldwin: And by "heard," I really just mean heard.
Daniel Baldwin: Because I don't think I was able to contribute anything to the conversation.
Yes, I can understand that feeling.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this weather?
Daniel Baldwin: A dreadful storm, if you ask me.
Daniel Baldwin: I don't know what's planned for tomorrow, but I hope it doesn't involve leaving this house.
Menu Choice: How old are you?
Daniel Baldwin: I'm 39 years old. Why do you ask?
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for him
Menu Choice: Leave the room
Map Choice: Tea room
There's no one here.
There's no reason to linger.
It has been a long day.
I cannot stay up any longer.
It is time to go to bed.
After taking a bit of time to get ready, I can get into bed.
I have no problem falling asleep.
Despite the storm that raged all night, I managed to sleep rather well.
So, I take my time getting ready and then go downstairs to the dining room.
Some of the guests are already eating.
I take a plate at the breakfast buffet and then sit down in the same place at the table as yesterday.
Captain Sinha is there, but I do not feel like engaging in conversation with him.
It is too early for that.
After a while, Ted Harring joins me at the table.
Amelia Baxter: Hello, Mr Harring. How are you?
Ted Harring: Very well, thank you.
Amelia Baxter: I was wondering if everyone would join us on time.
Amelia Baxter: There are still a few people missing.
Amelia Baxter: For instance, I don't think we'll see Mr Manning anytime soon.
Amelia Baxter: He was so drunk yesterday that I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't show up before noon.
Right after saying those words, Samuel Manning steps into the room.
Displaying evident unease, he makes his way to the buffet and, with trembling hands, selects a plate.
He appears to still be drunk, or at least seriously hungover.
Amelia Baxter: Well, I spoke too soon. Here he is. And in such a state.
Amelia Baxter: How dreadful.
While I am watching Samuel Manning, the butler enters and discreetly shares a message with Lady Claythorn.
Her alarmed expression indicates the gravity of the news.
Rising, she approaches, pausing only when she reaches the doctor.
Lady Claythorn: Doctor Baldwin, I'm sorry to interrupt your breakfast, but would you mind coming with me?
Lady Claythorn: We need your assistance.
Without hesitation, Daniel Baldwin stands up.
Daniel Baldwin: Of course, I'll follow you.
For some reason, Ted Harring also stands up and follows them.
It seems I am left with Sushil Sinha.
Amelia Baxter: Good morning, Mr Sinha.
Sushil Sinha: Miss Baxter.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this place?
Sushil Sinha: It's a splendid house.
Sushil Sinha: A bit old, and it could use some renovations.
Sushil Sinha: But I know it is no easy task.
Sushil Sinha: I have seen my fair share of grand buildings and stately homes, and I can confidently say that renovating an old Victorian mansion is no easy feat.
Sushil Sinha: The challenge lies in balancing the preservation of the building's historical integrity with the necessary updates and modernizations for contemporary living.
Sushil Sinha: One issue that often arises is the cost of renovations.
Sushil Sinha: Victorian mansions were built with materials and techniques that are not always easily replicated today, making repairs and replacements quite expensive.
Sushil Sinha: Additionally, many of these homes have unique architectural features that require specialized skills and knowledge to maintain.
Sushil Sinha: Another obstacle to overcome is the potential for structural issues.
Sushil Sinha: Victorian mansions are often quite old, and over time, they can suffer from wear and tear.
Sushil Sinha: This means that any renovation work will need to be done with an eye towards ensuring the building's stability and safety.
Sushil Sinha: Personally, I believe that renovating an old Victorian mansion is a noble endeavor.
Sushil Sinha: These buildings are a testament to a bygone era and preserving them for future generations is important.
Sushil Sinha: However, it is crucial to approach the task with a realistic understanding of the challenges and costs involved.
Sushil Sinha: A balance must be struck between maintaining the historical integrity of the building and ensuring that it is functional and comfortable for modern living.
Sushil Sinha: Ultimately, renovating an old Victorian mansion is not for the faint of heart, but for those who are willing to put in the time, effort, and resources, the end result can be truly spectacular.
Another long story.
But how does he know such things?
Is he one of those bookish people who read about everything and anything?
Menu Choice: What room are you in?
Sushil Sinha: The 'George I' Bedroom.
Sushil Sinha: An ordinary room named after an ordinary King.
Sushil Sinha: The only remarkable thing about 'George I' is that ...
Amelia Baxter: He was a foreigner, yes.
Amelia Baxter: As the first King of the house of Hanover, he was born in Germany and had a very limited grasp of English.
Sushil Sinha: Well, I was going to say his reign marked the beginning of the gradual transformation of the British monarchy into a more constitutional one,
Sushil Sinha: with real political power shifting towards Parliament and ministers.
Sushil Sinha: But I guess you're right too.
Suddenly, Lady Claythorn and the butler are back in the room.
Sushil Sinha: Lady Claythorn, what is happening?
The lady is visibly distressed.
Lady Claythorn: I'm sorry to announce such horrible news, everyone.
Lady Claythorn: It appears that Mr Moody passed away in his sleep last night.
The room instantly falls silent.
Sushil Sinha: Do we know what happened?
Lady Claythorn: Doctor Baldwin is examining him right now.
Lady Claythorn: He will likely tell us more later.
She then sits down in her chair.
Everyone looks shaken up.
Sushil Sinha: How terrible.
Amelia Baxter: Yes, such sad news.
We continue eating slowly in silence for a moment when the doctor enters the room.
Lady Claythorn: Doctor Baldwin, can you tell us more about what happened?
Daniel Baldwin: I can't say anything definitive for now.
Daniel Baldwin: But it's very likely a natural death, possibly triggered by an old wound from the war.
Daniel Baldwin: In any case, we need to call the authorities.
Lady Claythorn: Yes, of course.
Lady Claythorn: My butler will take care of it.
Daniel Baldwin: Very well.
We then continue eating in sad silence.
Nobody speaks much.
Lady Claythorn: Well, as I mentioned earlier, activities were planned for today.
Lady Claythorn: This morning, those who wished to were supposed to go on a hunt.
Lady Claythorn: A sad event has happened, but it's not a reason to remain idle.
Lady Claythorn: So, if no one objects, I propose that we continue according to what was planned.
A murmur of assent runs through the assembly.
Lady Claythorn: Excellent.
Lady Claythorn: Everything is ready for those who wish to join the hunt.
Lady Claythorn: I know most of you are probably not accustomed to this type of event.
Lady Claythorn: That's why our staff can lend you everything you'll need—clothes, guns—and they will also assist you throughout the event.
Lady Claythorn: Of course, you can choose to simply stay here.
Lady Claythorn: You can relax and enjoy the warmth of the house until the others return.
That's impressive.
People seem eager to move on really quickly.
Well, let them enjoy their game.
Obviously, I will stay here this afternoon.
I let everyone know that I am opting out of the hunt.
It turns out Rosalind Marsh is the only other one who made the same choice.
We agreed to meet shortly for luncheon in the tea room.
I should find her there a bit before noon.
Map Choice: Richard III Bedroom
The doctor left Thomas Moody's room open.
I guess he didn't think anyone would come to take a look.
I know I shouldn't have, but I couldn't resist.
Maybe I didn't believe it.
But here he lies, dead in his bed.
I try to look at him, but the emotion is overwhelming.
I can't stay here any longer.
I rush out of the room.
Map Choice: Queen Alexandra
I knock on the door.
Rosalind Marsh: Yes? Who's there?
Amelia Baxter: It's Amelia Baxter.
Rosalind Marsh: Oh, Mrs. Baxter, I'm really tired right now.
Rosalind Marsh: Can this wait until luncheon?
Amelia Baxter: Of course, sorry for bothering you.
Map Choice: Garden
A lovely garden.
I took a peaceful stroll through it.
Still, I notice nothing out of the ordinary.
It's almost time for lunch, I should go wait in the Tea Room.
I am the first to arrive, so I pick a table and wait for Rosalind Marsh.
I am seated comfortably, lost in my thoughts when she enters the room.
Amelia Baxter: Miss Marsh, would you like to join me?
Rosalind Marsh: Yes, thank you.
Amelia Baxter: It seems we haven't really had a chance to talk yet, right?
Menu Choice: Tell me more about yourself.
Rosalind Marsh: Oh well, the most obvious thing about me is that I am a nurse.
Rosalind Marsh: I started young and served in various wars.
Rosalind Marsh: In peacetime, I usually took a job at a hospital.
Rosalind Marsh: Now I mostly nurse the elderly.
Amelia Baxter: In an old person's facility?
Rosalind Marsh: No, not like that. I mostly assist wealthier individuals who require special in-house assistance.
Amelia Baxter: Are you taking care of someone at the moment?
Rosalind Marsh: Not right now.
Rosalind Marsh: And perhaps after I receive this prize, I won't have to.
Rosalind Marsh: Nursing is an amazing job that I love,
Rosalind Marsh: but it can be exhausting.
Amelia Baxter: Yes, one can imagine.
Menu Choice: Why were you invited here?
Rosalind Marsh: It is nothing special, really.
Rosalind Marsh: But it turns out I am the nurse who served in the most wars in the whole country, apparently.
Amelia Baxter: Oh my, that is extraordinary.
Amelia Baxter: But how many wars did you serve in?
Rosalind Marsh: There have been quite a few, that's true.
Rosalind Marsh: I started my career really early during the Cretan Revolt, where I was stationed on a British frigate.
Rosalind Marsh: But I truly experienced the horror of war for the first time during the Boxer Rebellion of 1899.
Rosalind Marsh: The brutality of the combats, then later, the lives they left behind made an impression that would last my whole life.
Rosalind Marsh: Afterwards, I followed the army again in small engagements in India.
Rosalind Marsh: When the Great War started, I thought at first that I was too old to go.
Rosalind Marsh: But the atrocities I kept hearing about left me no choice.
Rosalind Marsh: I had to be there to help.
Rosalind Marsh: It's what I do.
Rosalind Marsh: So I joined again and lasted throughout the whole duration of the war.
Amelia Baxter: How commendable.
Menu Choice: How old are you?
Rosalind Marsh: I am 42 years old.
Rosalind Marsh: It's hard to believe really.
Rosalind Marsh: I don't feel that old at all.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this place?
Rosalind Marsh: It's a grand house.
Rosalind Marsh: I've been in many houses of the same style, but none so big or impressive.
Suddenly, a staff member walks in.
Young woman: Excuse me for interrupting, but do you ladies need some lunch?
Rosalind Marsh: That would be lovely, thank you.
After a few minutes, she returns with some plates.
As we eat, we chat about trivial matters.
When our lunch is over, Rosalind rises from her seat.
She lets out a painful cough.
Rosalind Marsh: I'm feeling rather poorly.
Rosalind Marsh: I think I will retire to my room.
Rosalind Marsh: Would you mind being left on your own?
Amelia Baxter: Not at all, please don't concern yourself.
Amelia Baxter: There is more than enough here to occupy me.
With the manor so quiet, I might seize the chance to explore unnoticed.
And perhaps I should call upon Rosalind Marsh later, to see how she is doing.
What should I do know?
Map Choice: Go back to the Tea Room
There's no one here.
There's no reason to linger.
Map Choice: Library
Here is an impressive library.
"A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain." is open on a table.
But I don't feel like reading now.
Map Choice: Portrait Gallery
There are quite a few impressive portraits here.
However, no one else is present.
Map Choice: Entrance Hall
A very nice great hall.
But it is totally empty.
Map Choice: Billiard room
The billiard room is empty right now.
I should leave.
Map Choice: Dining Room
The dining area is currently unoccupied.
I shouldn't stay here.
Map Choice: Go check on Rosalind Marsh
I knock on Rosalind Marsh's door.
Rosalind Marsh: Yes? Who is there?
Amelia Baxter: It is me again.
Amelia Baxter: I wanted to see how you were faring.
She slightly opens the door but stays inside.
Rosalind Marsh: Oh, Mrs Baxter, I am not feeling at all well.
Rosalind Marsh: Could it wait?
A harsh cough rakes her chest.
Rosalind Marsh: I am sorry.
Amelia Baxter: Are you quite all right?
Rosalind Marsh: Yes, it is nothing, really.
Rosalind Marsh: I am only a little under the weather.
She takes out her handkerchief and presses it to her mouth.
She tries to slip it quickly back into her pocket.
Yet I catch a glimpse of blood upon the linen.
She is worse than she would have me believe.
Rosalind Marsh: I should lie down now.
She is plainly uncomfortable.
But perhaps I could press her a little.
Menu Choice: Insist, something is clearly wrong here
Amelia Baxter: I am afraid it is important.
Amelia Baxter: Might you let me in? It will not take long.
Rosalind Marsh: Very well, do come in.
Rosalind Marsh: What can I do for you?
Amelia Baxter: Nothing, rather the reverse.
Amelia Baxter: I am sorry to intrude, but I noticed the blood on your handkerchief.
Amelia Baxter: I wondered whether there is anything I can do to help.
Rosalind Marsh: I suppose I could not have hidden it forever.
Rosalind Marsh: You see, I am suffering from a most serious disease.
Rosalind Marsh: One for which there is no known cure. Consumption.
Another racking cough takes her.
Amelia Baxter: I am so very sorry.
Amelia Baxter: When did you learn of it?
Rosalind Marsh: A couple of years ago.
Rosalind Marsh: And if I am to trust my doctor, I have perhaps a year at most.
Amelia Baxter: My goodness, how horrible.
Amelia Baxter: Is there anything at all I can do?
Rosalind Marsh: There is nothing to be done.
Rosalind Marsh: My doctor has prescribed a strong draught that I must take before bed.
Rosalind Marsh: It usually helps me to sleep.
Rosalind Marsh: At times I must take it during the day, which is why I am so often in my room, resting.
Rosalind Marsh: But you should go now. I shall try to sleep a little before dinner.
Rosalind Marsh: Thank you for your kindness.
Amelia Baxter: Of course. I shall go.
Rosalind Marsh: Thank you.
Map Choice: Kitchen
The basement is where the domestic staff work.
I definitely shouldn't go down there, it's not my place.
Suddenly, noises from the main entrance catch my attention.
I should investigate.
I observe the hunting party as they make their way into the house.
Lady Claythorn steps through the doorway first, her expression one of utter disbelief.
Following close behind are the butler and footman.
They carefully carry someone on an improvised stretcher.
Amelia Baxter: Oh my God! What happened!?
Amelia Baxter: Is that Doctor Baldwin? Is he injured?
Amelia Baxter: Oh no! Is he... dead?
Sushil Sinha: I'm sorry, dear, but he is.
Amelia Baxter: But... what happened?
Sushil Sinha: It was an accident.
Samuel Manning: I swear it was! I have no idea how I could have hit him.
Samuel Manning: I was aiming at a rabbit. I didn't even see him.
Everyone turns to him.
Amelia Baxter: You fool! You were probably too drunk, and that's why you hit him.
Amelia Baxter: You could barely walk this morning. Who gave you a gun?
Sushil Sinha: Please, there's no need to point fingers now. It's done.
Sushil Sinha: The police will handle it.
Sushil Sinha: Speaking of which, has anyone from the city arrived yet?
Amelia Baxter: No, not yet.
Amelia Baxter: We're still waiting for them.
Sushil Sinha: We should tell them to hurry.
Sushil Sinha: Lady Claythorn, where's the phone?
Lady Claythorn: I'll handle it.
She leaves the group, with the butler following closely behind.
The room falls silent.
Most eyes are on Sam Manning, filled with disdain.
Then, the hostess returns.
Lady Claythorn: I just spoke with the police. They aren't coming today.
Sushil Sinha: What!? Why not?
Lady Claythorn: They were on their way but encountered a huge tree blocking the road.
Lady Claythorn: They couldn't get past it.
Lady Claythorn: They said they'll be back tomorrow with assistance.
Amelia Baxter: But... what are we going to do with him until then?
Sushil Sinha: We'll move him to his bed for now.
Sushil Sinha: It's the best we can do under the circumstances.
Sushil Sinha: Anyone willing to help?
Ted Harring: I will.
I watch Captain Sinha and Ted Harring carry Doctor Baldwin to his room.
Now, the attention of everyone turns to Samuel Manning.
I realise no one has thought about restraining him in any way.
But it seems unnecessary as he is sitting on the stairs,
his gaze empty, apparently unaware of what is happening about him.
Lady Claythorn discreetly approaches her butler to converse with him, almost whispering.
Lady Claythorn: What should we do about him?
Lady Claythorn: We certainly can't allow him to wander freely.
Butler: It's difficult to say.
Butler: Ordinarily, this would be a matter for the police.
Butler: However, these are extraordinary circumstances, which leave me at a loss.
Rosalind Marsh: Indeed, but that shouldn't stop us from taking measures.
Rosalind Marsh: Our safety must be a priority.
Rosalind Marsh: While he may appear harmless now, it's uncertain if that will remain so.
Rosalind Marsh: Once the effect of the alcohol wanes and he grasps his situation, who knows how he'll respond.
Rosalind Marsh: There's a risk he could attempt to escape.
Amelia Baxter: Or, he might lash out and harm someone.
Rosalind Marsh: Precisely!
Rosalind Marsh: So we are in agreement, something needs to be done?
Everyone agrees, albeit silently.
Butler: The most sensible course would seem to be confining him to his room.
Butler: The doors are sufficiently robust, and considering his current condition, it's unlikely he'd manage to break free even if he tried.
Lady Claythorn: Yes, that seems like a prudent measure.
At that moment, Sushil Sinha makes his return from upstairs.
Ted Harring is not with him.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Harring needed to change, he'll join us shortly.
Lady Claythorn: Ah, Captain! It's good you're here.
Lady Claythorn: We've been deliberating over what action to take concerning Samuel Manning.
Sushil Sinha: I see.
Sushil Sinha: And what is your plan?
Lady Claythorn: We've decided to confine him to his chamber.
Lady Claythorn: At least until the authorities can take over.
Sushil Sinha: That does seem like the wisest approach.
He shifts his attention towards Samuel Manning.
Sushil Sinha: I hope you understand we're left with little choice right now.
Samuel Manning gives no sign of comprehension.
Samuel Manning: Choice? What choice?
Samuel Manning: What do you mean?
Sushil Sinha: You have to retire to your room for now.
Sushil Sinha: The door will be locked from the outside to ensure you don't get out.
Sushil Sinha: Is that clear?
Samuel Manning: Yes, of course...
Samuel Manning: I understand.
Sushil Sinha: Good, come with me, please.
The butler retrieves a set of keys from his pocket.
After sifting through them, he presents one to Mr Sinha.
Butler: Use this key to lock his room.
Sushil Sinha: Excellent, thank you.
Sushil Sinha: Now, Mr Manning, let's go shall we?
Samuel Manning offers a silent nod, rises, and follows Captain Sinha up the staircase.
His gaze betrays a mix of resignation and confusion.
We all watch the two men leave down the stairs.
Then an awkward silence fills the room.
Lady Claythorn: What a sad business.
Lady Claythorn: But, sadly, there is nothing else to be done at the moment.
Lady Claythorn: I suggest you all return to your rooms for now.
Lady Claythorn: You'll hear the gong when dinner is ready.
Before heading to my room, there is something I would like to understand.
I approach the butler.
Butler: Yes, Miss Baxter?
Amelia Baxter: I don't understand; how could you give a gun to someone so drunk?
Butler: I am so sorry, but he wasn't drunk when we talked this morning.
Butler: He was acting totally normally.
Butler: He probably got drunk during the day.
Butler: There was nothing I could have done.
Amelia Baxter: Right.
He did seem very drunk to me at breakfast, though.
I return to my room to change and collect my thoughts.
So much has happened today, it is overwhelming.
I use this brief respite to compose myself.
There is little time before dinner, so I could wait here,
or take the opportunity to have a private word with someone.
I do not think it would be wise to approach Captain Sinha,
nor Lady Claythorn.
And I should let Rosalind Marsh rest.
However, I do not believe I am taking too much of a risk by talking with Ted Harring.
Menu Choice: Try to talk to Ted Harring
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, may I come in?
Ted Harring: Come on in, Mrs. Baxter. The door is open.
Amelia Baxter: I'm sorry to intrude, but I believe we should talk.
Amelia Baxter: Something dangerous is happening here.
Ted Harring: What do you mean?
Amelia Baxter: Don't you find it strange that two different people died in the same place, from two different causes?
Ted Harring: Well, I don't know about Thomas Moody.
Ted Harring: But for the doctor's death, you said it yourself: Samuel Manning was probably drunk.
Ted Harring: That's tragic, but not really surprising.
Amelia Baxter: That's what I initially thought.
Amelia Baxter: However, I just spoke with the butler. He insisted that Samuel Manning was clear-minded when he handed him his gun.
Ted Harring: So, what, you think he staged the accident?
Ted Harring: He might've just drank too much during the hunt.
Amelia Baxter: Possibly, but it's still suspicious.
Amelia Baxter: I have other reasons to believe something is amiss here.
Amelia Baxter: Let's just say, I have a feeling.
Ted Harring: You can "feel" it?
Amelia Baxter: Don't dismiss what you don't understand, Mr Harring.
Amelia Baxter: But it's okay. I don't need you to believe me.
Amelia Baxter: I'm simply warning you to be cautious.
Ted Harring: Are you scared of Samuel Manning?
Amelia Baxter: Yes, but not just him.
Amelia Baxter: Others might be involved too.
Amelia Baxter: I don't think we can trust anyone fully.
Ted Harring: Yet, you seem to trust me.
Amelia Baxter: Well, I wouldn't put it that way.
Amelia Baxter: If someone were after me, I'd be defenseless. So, I need an ally.
Amelia Baxter: You seem capable of defending both of us if there's a direct confrontation.
Amelia Baxter: So, I chose to confide in you.
Amelia Baxter: It is dinner time.
Amelia Baxter: Not that I'm particularly hungry.
Amelia Baxter: But we should head downstairs regardless.
He nods in agreement.
Amelia Baxter: I believe we should continue this conversation later.
Amelia Baxter: If you agree, come see me in my room after dinner.
As I step into the dining room, a sombre ambience surrounds me.
The chairs where Daniel Baldwin and Thomas Moody usually sat are empty.
Samuel Manning is not here either, of course.
I settle into my familiar place, with Ted Harring to my right.
Lady Claythorn stands up to speak.
Lady Claythorn: Now that everyone is here, I want to express my deepest regret for what happened today.
Lady Claythorn: This isn't how I imagined our weekend.
Lady Claythorn: I don't believe any of us are in the mood for more entertainment.
Lady Claythorn: So, tomorrow morning, you'll receive your rewards.
Lady Claythorn: Afterward, we'll wait for the police to arrive.
Lady Claythorn: You're free to head home as soon as the officers give the all-clear.
Lady Claythorn: For now, enjoy your dinner.
Lady Claythorn: Drinks will be available in the billiard room afterwards, as they were yesterday.
The food is served shortly after the speech.
Yet, most of us have little appetite.
Ted Harring: Miss Baxter, I don't see Samuel Manning.
Ted Harring: Do you know where he might be?
Amelia Baxter: He's locked in his room.
Amelia Baxter: After you left, there was a debate about how to handle him.
Amelia Baxter: Ultimately, we decided it best to confine him to his room.
Amelia Baxter: He didn't resist.
Amelia Baxter: That's where he is now.
Amelia Baxter: It was agreed that his dinner would be served there.
We ate in silence.
After dinner, most people retired to their rooms.
I do not think many will join for a drink afterwards.
So I could also take advantage of the fact that the Manor is almost empty.
Or I could wait in my room for Ted Harring.
What should I do?
Map Choice: Tea room
There's no one here.
There's no reason to linger.
Map Choice: Garden
I reach the large hall and prepare to open the door.
The weather has improved, but it is pitch dark outside.
What possessed me? There is no reason to go out now.
Map Choice: Entrance Hall
A very nice great hall.
But it is totally empty.
Map Choice: Kitchen
The basement is where the domestic staff work.
I definitely shouldn't go down there, it's not my place.
Map Choice: Library
Here is an impressive library.
"A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain." is open on a table.
But I don't feel like reading now.
Map Choice: Portrait Gallery
The paintings remain unchanged.
There's no need to wander the house further.
I should return to my room.
After a little while, someone knocks at my door.
Ted Harring: Miss Baxter?
Ted Harring: Are you here? It's Ted Harring.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, are you alone?
Ted Harring: I am.
Amelia Baxter: Come on in then.
Amelia Baxter: So, have you given any thought to what I told you?
Amelia Baxter: Do you agree that something isn't right?
Ted Harring: I'm not sure yet. But what happened is strange enough that we should take some precautions.
Amelia Baxter: I'm glad you agree.
Amelia Baxter: I've given this a lot of thought, and I believe if what I fear is true, Samuel Manning had help from someone else.
Ted Harring: Do you mean a guest? Or could someone from the staff be involved?
Amelia Baxter: I wouldn't rule anything out, but it seems less likely that the staff or Lady Claythorn would be implicated.
Amelia Baxter: Such an act would require a massive operation.
Amelia Baxter: No, a more plausible theory is that one or two individuals heard about the event and took the places of real guests to infiltrate the manor.
Ted Harring: But why would they do that?
Amelia Baxter: Well, it's rather obvious, isn't it?
Amelia Baxter: The prize money, of course.
Amelia Baxter: It was mentioned in the invitation letter that the prize will be given in bearer's bonds.
Ted Harring: Bearer's bonds?
Amelia Baxter: That's a note that you can exchange at the bank without having to prove your identity.
Amelia Baxter: So, it's almost as easy to use as cash.
Ted Harring: That's a lot of money hidden somewhere in the manor.
Ted Harring: So you think it could be a mere robbery?
Ted Harring: Why not just directly attack the manor?
Amelia Baxter: It's easier to enter incognito.
Amelia Baxter: First, observe and then discreetly eliminate potential threats.
Amelia Baxter: That's the most likely explanation I could think of.
Ted Harring: I suppose that's possible.
Ted Harring: But there's no way to determine who might be involved.
Amelia Baxter: Exactly.
Amelia Baxter: That's why I suggest we stay safely in our rooms tonight.
Amelia Baxter: Tomorrow morning, the first one of us to wake up should alert the other.
Amelia Baxter: Then we stick together the entire day until we can safely leave.
Amelia Baxter: What do you think?
Ted Harring: It sounds like a good plan.
Ted Harring: Let's do it.
Amelia Baxter: Great!
Amelia Baxter: Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
Ted Harring: Not really. About what?
Menu Choice: What room are you in?
Ted Harring: Oh, I am in the "William the Conqueror" Bedroom.
Amelia Baxter: An impressive king.
Ted Harring: Really, he was?
Is he serious?
Hasn't he heard of "William the Conqueror"?
Amelia Baxter: Well, he was a French Duke who was able to take the throne of England from very powerful men.
Amelia Baxter: That's not nothing.
Amelia Baxter: On the other hand, he was sometimes also called the Bastard King.
Amelia Baxter: So make of that what you will.
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for him
Amelia Baxter: I believe it's getting quite late.
Amelia Baxter: We ought to get some rest now.
Ted Harring: Of course, I'll see you tomorrow.
Unsurprisingly, I slept terribly.
At least it's the last day. All of this will be over soon.
Now I need to get my things ready and head to Ted Harring.
On my way to Ted's, the emptiness of the Manor hits me.
There is not a sound that can be heard.
It gives me a chill.
I stop in front of his door.
He is not responding.
I hope he is well.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, are you there?
Ted Harring: I'm coming!
Finally, I was getting worried.
He opens the door for me and I enter.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Haring, I believe my hunch was right yesterday.
Amelia Baxter: Something strange is afoot.
Ted Harring: What do you mean?
Amelia Baxter: I haven't seen any staff members on my way here.
Amelia Baxter: At this hour, they should be busy with lighting fires, cleaning and setting up breakfast.
Amelia Baxter: Yet, I neither saw nor heard anyone.
Amelia Baxter: It's as silent as a graveyard in here.
Ted Harring: Are you sure it's not just because it's so early?
Amelia Baxter: I'm certain.
Amelia Baxter: I was up at the same time yesterday, and the house was bustling with activity.
Amelia Baxter: Something's not right, I assure you.
Ted Harring: Okay, if you say so.
Ted Harring: But how is that related to a robbery?
Amelia Baxter: I'm not so sure anymore that this is about a robbery.
Amelia Baxter: I have a feeling it could be something much worse.
He paused for a second there, he must have realised it's serious.
Ted Harring: Alright, we'd better investigate then.
And we started to look for others in the manor,
inspecting every room.
I let him choose where we were going,
even though his choices didn't always make much sense.
We searched the Manor extensively, but we didn't find much anything interesting.
Ted Harring insisted on taking an empty gun from the gun room.
I am not sure what he intends to do with it.
Tired and demoralised, we decided to take a break in the tea room.
We rested there until we heard a familiar voice.
Sushil Sinha: Is anyone here?
Ted Harring: Yes, Ted Harring. I'm here, and Amelia Baxter's with me.
Sushil Sinha: At last, living, breathing souls.
Sushil Sinha: I was starting to feel like I was in a ghost house.
Amelia Baxter: We feel the same. You're the first person we've encountered today as well.
Ted Harring: Do you have any idea what's going on?
Sushil Sinha: Nothing concrete. All I know is, I don't like it.
Sushil Sinha: People don't just vanish from their homes without reason.
Amelia Baxter: They certainly don't.
Sushil Sinha: And then there's the matter of the suspicious deaths.
Sushil Sinha: I could've dismissed them as bad luck yesterday, but now... I'm not so certain.
There is an awkward silence.
Ted Harring: By the way, did you check on Samuel Manning?
Ted Harring: You're the only one with the key to his room.
Sushil Sinha: No, not yet. I assumed he couldn't have gone far.
Sushil Sinha: But you're right, we should check on him.
Ted Harring: I think so too.
Ted Harring: We'll follow you.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Manning, are you there?
No response.
Sushil Sinha: Alright, I'm going in.
Without warning, he opens the door and enters.
We quickly follow him, but he attempts to stop us.
Sushil Sinha: Wait! Don't come in.
But we are already in.
There lies Samuel Manning, dead in his bed.
Blood is all over him.
I let out a gasp.
Sushil Sinha: Miss Baxter, please don't stay here.
Without a word, Sushil Sinha drags me out of the room.
Sushil Sinha: I regret letting you see that.
Sushil Sinha: You shouldn't have entered.
Amelia Baxter: Is... is he... dead?
Sushil Sinha: I'm afraid so.
Ted Harring: Are you certain?
Ted Harring: Shouldn't we check his pulse?
Ted Harring: Maybe... just maybe, there's a chance he's alive.
Sushil Sinha: I'm sorry, but it's too late.
Sushil Sinha: I've seen enough dead people to know. He's been gone for a long time.
Sushil Sinha: Likely since last night.
Amelia Baxter: Oh my God.
Ted Harring looks terribly distraught.
Looking less affected, Captain Sinha guides us back to the tea room.
Sushil Sinha: Miss Baxter, you should probably rest here for a little bit.
Sushil Sinha: I have something to check out, and I'll be back soon.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Harring, would you mind coming with me?
Ted Harring: Well, sure.
Ted Harring: I'll follow you.
Amelia Baxter: Please don't be long.
Sushil Sinha: Don't worry, this should only take a few minutes.
I sat there quietly, pondering what had happened, what I should do next.
After some time, they came back.
Amelia Baxter: You've been gone for a while. What happened?
Sushil Sinha: I'm afraid we haven't been able to find Miss Marsh.
Sushil Sinha: Her room was locked, so we forced it open.
Sushil Sinha: But it was all for naught, as it was empty.
Amelia Baxter: Well, what should we do now?
Sushil Sinha: You both seem a bit shaken up.
Sushil Sinha: That's not surprising, given what you've witnessed.
Sushil Sinha: It's easier for me.
Sushil Sinha: Sadly, I've seen my share of dead people.
Sushil Sinha: So I suggest you two rest for a bit while I continue to explore the manor.
Sushil Sinha: I'll be back soon.
I have no objection to that.
Ted Harring seems to want to say something, then changes his mind.
We waited in the tea room without exchanging any words for a short time.
Finally, Captain Sinha comes back.
Sushil Sinha: I believe I've looked absolutely everywhere now.
Sushil Sinha: There is no trace of anyone.
Sushil Sinha: I also tried to use the telephone, and it's not working.
Sushil Sinha: Thus, there is no way for us to call for help.
Sushil Sinha: The way I see it now, we don't have many options left.
Sushil Sinha: I believe we must leave this place.
Sushil Sinha: The longer we stay, the more at risk we are.
Amelia Baxter: But... shouldn't we wait for the police?
Amelia Baxter: They were expected today. They could arrive any moment.
Sushil Sinha: I wouldn't count on it.
Sushil Sinha: From what I gather, there's no evidence that the police were called yesterday.
Amelia Baxter: But Miss Claythorn said...
Amelia Baxter: She said...
Amelia Baxter: I see, you believe she never called.
Amelia Baxter: That the police have no idea about what's happened here.
Amelia Baxter: That she lied to us.
Sushil Sinha: That's the most logical explanation.
Sushil Sinha: No one was around when the phone calls were supposedly made.
Sushil Sinha: So, there's no way to verify if they actually happened.
Ted Harring: But why?
Ted Harring: Why would anyone do this?
Ted Harring: I don't understand what's happening.
Sushil Sinha: Neither do I.
Sushil Sinha: I've thought about it, and I have no clue why we were all invited here.
Sushil Sinha: I'm certain it wasn't to give us any money.
Sushil Sinha: In any case, all I know is we need to leave as soon as possible.
Amelia Baxter: But how could we leave?
Amelia Baxter: The nearest town is miles away.
Amelia Baxter: I can't walk that far.
Amelia Baxter: And even if I could, I'm not prepared for such a journey.
Sushil Sinha: You might be right.
Sushil Sinha: It would be a long walk, and the weather might turn at any moment.
Sushil Sinha: We could get caught in another storm.
Sushil Sinha: It's probably unsafe for you to join us.
Amelia Baxter: But you're not going to leave me here alone, are you?
Amelia Baxter: What would become of me?
Sushil Sinha: We could lock you in a room.
Sushil Sinha: Though, that's far from ideal.
Sushil Sinha: Perhaps one of us should stay with you.
Amelia Baxter: Yes!
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring can stay with me, right?
Amelia Baxter: The two of us should be safe until you return with help.
Sushil Sinha: That seems to be the wisest choice.
Sushil Sinha: What do you think, Mr Harring?
Ted Harring: Of course, I'll stay.
Ted Harring: Only a monster would leave you alone here in this condition.
Amelia Baxter: Thank you Mr Haring!
Amelia Baxter: That means the world to me.
Sushil Sinha: Very well.
Sushil Sinha: I will go right now then. I don't want to lose time.
Sushil Sinha: Hopefully, I'll be back with help before nightfall.
Amelia Baxter: Thank you captain.
Amelia Baxter: I hope you'll be safe.
Ted Harring: Yes, thank you.
And then he is on his way.
Amelia Baxter: Well, there's no point in waiting around doing nothing.
Amelia Baxter: We haven't eaten since yesterday.
Amelia Baxter: I could check the kitchen to see if there's anything I can prepare.
Ted Harring: Okay, I'll come with you.
On our way to the basement, I hear a familiar voice.
Rosalind Marsh: Hello!
Rosalind Marsh: Is there someone here?
Amelia Baxter: Oh my God, Miss Marsh, you're here!
Rosalind Marsh: Of course I am here. Why do you look so surprised?
Rosalind Marsh: I'm afraid I overslept. I don't feel quite like myself today.
Rosalind Marsh: When I woke up, I went to check the dining room but found it empty.
Rosalind Marsh: I wandered in the house for a while but I didn't see anyone until I met you.
Rosalind Marsh: Where is everybody?
Amelia Baxter: Oh my dear, we don't know.
We explained the situation to her as best we could.
She doesn't appear very alarmed by it.
I am finding that peculiar.
Rosalind Marsh: Poor Mr Manning, what a terrible fate.
Rosalind Marsh: And what horror that must have been for you, my dear.
Rosalind Marsh: Are you all right?
Amelia Baxter: I am better now.
Amelia Baxter: Captain Sinha should be back with help soon, so I'll be fine if I can keep my mind occupied until then.
Amelia Baxter: Speaking of which, we were heading to the kitchen to see if we can prepare some sort of meal.
Rosalind Marsh: Right, it's a good idea. We might as well keep ourselves busy.
So we went downstairs.
We look around for something to eat.
Amelia Baxter: There isn't much.
Amelia Baxter: But I think we can manage a light luncheon if you're not picky.
Rosalind Marsh: I'll help you.
Mr Harring is nice enough to offer his help.
But I don't think he has much experience in this department.
So we decide it's best if he doesn't get involved.
When the food is ready, we go to the dining room to eat.
Ted Harring sets the table and then tries to leave.
Amelia Baxter: Where are you going, Mr Harring?
Amelia Baxter: It's better if we stick together at all times.
Ted Harring: I understand, but there's something I need to do alone.
Ted Harring: We haven't had a moment apart the entire day and...
Amelia Baxter: Say no more, I understand.
Amelia Baxter: I'm in the same situation.
Amelia Baxter: What about you, Miss Marsh?
Rosalind Marsh: Oh, I'm fine, thank you.
Rosalind Marsh: You both go, I'll finish preparing the table.
Amelia Baxter: Very well.
Amelia Baxter: Let's meet back here in a few minutes then.
Ted Harring: Of course.
We both go on to our room, leaving Amelia Baxter alone in the dining room.
I did not waste time going to my room and back, but Rosalind Marsh and Ted Harring are already seated when I come back.
Ted Harring must have been very fast, I suppose he was scared to stay alone for too long.
We start eating in silence, each deep in our own thoughts.
I don't eat much, nor does Mrs Marsh.
But Ted Harring finishes his plate,
then as soon as he is done, stands up.
He looks anxious to do something.
But as he stands, he suddenly looks dizzy.
Ted Harring: What's happening?
Ted Harring: Why am I...
He is unable to say another word before he collapses to the floor.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring?!
Rosalind Marsh rushes to his side.
Her nurse's training kicks in.
Rosalind Marsh: Mr Harring, can you hear me?
Amelia Baxter: What's happened?
Amelia Baxter: How is he?
Rosalind Marsh: He's not well, I don't understand.
She checks his heartbeat.
Rosalind Marsh: He has no pulse.
Rosalind Marsh: He's dead.
Amelia Baxter: What?! No, that can't be.
Amelia Baxter: How is this possible?
Rosalind Marsh: I'm not sure, but I doubt it's a coincidence at this point.
Rosalind Marsh: I believe he's been poisoned.
Amelia Baxter: No, no, no ...
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, why?
My hands shake.
Tears run down my cheeks.
Rosalind Marsh keeps talking, but I can barely understand what she's saying.
Rosalind Marsh: All I know is that he wasn't the target.
Rosalind Marsh: I switched my plate with his before we started eating.
Rosalind Marsh: I was the one supposed to die, not him.
Amelia Baxter: You switched plates? Why?
Rosalind Marsh: Why?!
Rosalind Marsh: After all that's happened, weren't you suspecting anything?
I try to form a coherent response, but words elude me.
Amelia Baxter: ...
Rosalind Marsh: When I woke to find this place empty, I knew something was wrong.
Rosalind Marsh: I heard the three of you rummaging around the house and I hid.
Rosalind Marsh: I didn't trust Sushil Sinha, but once he left I felt safe enough to reveal myself.
Rosalind Marsh: But I should have been more suspicious of Ted Harring.
Rosalind Marsh: After all, he was the least respectable of everyone here.
Rosalind Marsh: Clearly out of place in this environment.
Rosalind Marsh: And I bet I can prove it.
She searches Ted Harring's pockets and takes out a gun.
Rosalind Marsh: Look. He even had a weapon on him the whole time.
Rosalind Marsh: He...
She pauses.
Rosalind Marsh: I don't know what his motives were, but...
Rosalind Marsh: ...it doesn't matter now.
She clearly struggles to speak.
Rosalind Marsh: Wait, something feels off.
She grasps the chair next to her for support.
Rosalind Marsh: I think I'm going to faint.
Rosalind Marsh: What have you done?
I barely register her words.
It feels like I'm about to collapse myself.
Amelia Baxter: Me? What about me?
I turn towards her and see that she is pointing a gun at me.
Rosalind Marsh: Don't move.
Menu Choice: Try to take the gun by force. It's probably not loaded anyway
Without hesitation, I jump at her.
It happened so swiftly that she didn't have time to react.
Rosalind Marsh: Wait! I'll shoot.
But I am already upon her, grappling for the gun.
Rosalind Marsh: Stop, or I'll ...
The sound of a gunshot pierces the air, ending the fight.
Silence descends, heavy and suffocating.
I stand frozen, the nurse's body slumping to the ground.
The gun, now a cold weight in my hand, drops to the floor alongside her.
Amelia Baxter: No...
Tears cloud my vision as I stare at the horrific scene before me.
When I look upon the dead body, the room spins, I am overwhelmed with guilt and disbelief.
As I feel myself falling, I attempt to grasp the table but end up catching the tablecloth instead.
It is not strong enough to prevent my fall.
I am on the floor, having dragged most of the table's contents down with me.
Broken glass all around me now, shattered plates, spilled food...
I try to stand up but injure my hands on a shard of glass.
Once again, I fall onto my back.
Perhaps I should just rest here.
I have almost no strength left, anyway.
But I smell something.
Something is burning.
Only then do I see it,
a candle from the table,
now lying on the floor.
And all around it, flames,
spreading from the carpet to the entrance door.
The fire is spreading rapidly.
I make one last effort to stand and manage to get to my feet.
But I can see no way out.
Everything surrounding me is engulfed in smoke, so thick it's hard to breathe.
Upon this sight, the little strength I had left ebbs away.
As I am about to lose consciousness, my last feeling is a strong sense.
I never should have stayed here, I should have left when I had the chance.
The smoke from the fire caused you to lose consciousness.
Needless to say, you didn't survive it.
The whole place burned down.
A tragic ending for Claythorn Manor and everyone still within.
Select a Character
This invitation really isn't well written.
Vague instructions on how to reach the manor.
There's little information about who has been invited.
I suppose it wouldn't be surprising if some of the participants did not show up.
I cannot help feeling nervous about the whole thing.
Well, it's too late to turn back now.
We shall see what happens.
I step off the train and look around me.
On the platform, I spot a young man in a footman's livery.
He is talking to a tanned man with a serious expression.
I walk towards them.
Amelia Baxter: Excuse me, gentlemen. I'm heading to Claythorn Manor and was wondering if you could assist me.
Footman: Yes, of course. You must be Amelia Baxter.
Amelia Baxter: That's correct.
Footman: Perfect. I work for Lady Claythorn and have been instructed to take you to the manor.
Footman: The gentleman here is also coming with us.
Sushil Sinha: Nice to meet you, Miss Baxter.
He takes my hand and kisses it lightly.
At least here's someone with manners.
Amelia Baxter: How do you do, Mr ...
Sushil Sinha: Sinha, Sushil Sinha.
Amelia Baxter: Ah.
Amelia Baxter: Nice to meet you too, Mr Sinha.
Footman: I believe there's still someone on this train who is supposed to accompany us.
Footman: A Mr Manning.
Footman: Have either of you met him by any chance?
Sushil Sinha: I don't think so.
Amelia Baxter: Me neither.
Footman: Alright, maybe he missed it.
Footman: Let us wait a few minutes to be sure everyone has left this train, then we can move on.
As the train prepares to leave the station, I see someone stumbling out of a door, almost falling.
Since we're the only people left on the platform, he walks towards us, looking uncertain.
Footman: Hello, sir. Are you going to Claythorn Manor?
Samuel Manning: I am indeed.
Footman: Perfect, that should be everyone.
Footman: You can follow me to the car, and we'll be on our way.
Footman: It will take about an hour to reach the manor.
I take a seat in the back.
Sushil Sinha joins me.
Sushil Sinha: I hope you don't mind my sitting with you.
Sushil Sinha: I think it's better to let Mr Manning sit in front.
Amelia Baxter: Of course not.
I understand all too well what he means.
Samuel Manning seems quite out of sorts.
He attempts to make small talk with the driver, but his speech is incoherent.
The poor fellow does his best to ignore him and focus on the road.
When he realises no one wishes to talk to him, Samuel Manning takes a sip from a flask and immediately falls asleep in his seat.
The driver sighs with relief.
Sushil Sinha: Well, he's certainly had one too many.
Sushil Sinha: I hope he can sleep it off.
Sushil Sinha: It would be embarrassing for our host to greet him in this state.
Amelia Baxter: You are certainly right.
Amelia Baxter: I would rather discuss something else, if you do not mind.
Sushil Sinha: Not at all.
Menu Choice: Where are you from?
Sushil Sinha: I come directly from London.
Sushil Sinha: I have been living there for the last two decades.
Amelia Baxter: London.
Amelia Baxter: Right.
Amelia Baxter: But that's not what I meant.
Sushil Sinha: I am sorry, what did you mean?
Menu Choice: I mean, where are you "Really" from?
Sushil Sinha: Oh ... I was raised in Calcutta.
Sushil Sinha: But I've been living in England for so long that I don't even think about it anymore.
Amelia Baxter: Alright. Calcutta is in the far east, right?
Sushil Sinha: Yes, it's in North India.
Sushil Sinha: I was born there.
Sushil Sinha: Growing up, I was always fascinated by the stories of the Raj army and their brave officers.
Sushil Sinha: I knew from a young age that I wanted to join the army and serve my country.
Sushil Sinha: As I grew older, I began to prepare myself for the rigorous training that would be required to become an officer in the Raj army.
Sushil Sinha: I studied hard and practiced my shooting and horseback riding skills.
Sushil Sinha: I also learned about the history of India and the British Raj, so that I could understand the context of the conflicts that the army was involved in.
Sushil Sinha: Finally, in 1890, I was accepted into the Raj army as a cadet.
Sushil Sinha: The training was grueling, but I was determined to succeed.
Sushil Sinha: I was taught how to march, how to shoot, and how to lead my men in battle.
Sushil Sinha: I also learned about strategy and tactics, so that I could make quick decisions in the heat of battle.
Sushil Sinha: After two years of training, I was finally commissioned as an officer.
Sushil Sinha: I was assigned to a regiment and sent to the frontier, where I would be fighting against the tribes that were trying to rebel against the British Raj.
Sushil Sinha: It was a difficult and dangerous assignment, but I was determined to do my best.
Sushil Sinha: I led my men into battle and fought bravely, always thinking of the safety and well-being of my men.
Sushil Sinha: I was able to successfully quell the rebellion, and my men and I returned home as heroes.
Sushil Sinha: I continued to serve in the Raj army for many years, rising through the ranks and taking on more responsibility.
Sushil Sinha: As the years went by, I was increasingly exposed to the ways of the British army and began to adopt their techniques and strategies.
Sushil Sinha: I was eventually sent to London to train new officers, ...
My god, he is going to tell me his whole life story.
How rude.
And there is no way to avoid him here.
So I nod in assent and barely listens to what he is saying.
After what seems an eternity, the manor appears on the horizon.
That finally puts an end to Captain Sinha's monologue.
Sushil Sinha: Ah, it looks like we're arriving at our destination.
Sushil Sinha: What a magnificent home.
He's right, it is beautiful.
However, the storm lends it a somewhat sinister aspect.
Nevertheless, its appearance reassures me somewhat.
Such a house suggests its owner must be incredibly wealthy.
Everything ought to be fine from now on.
The three of us walk towards the entrance while the driver attends to our luggage.
Samuel Manning wakes up when the car stops. He looks somewhat better than before.
When we reach the main door, a butler greets us.
Butler: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Claythorn Manor.
Butler: I'm sorry that Lady Claythorn can't greet you herself.
Butler: She is still busy preparing for tonight.
Butler: In the meantime, you can enjoy some drinks in the tea room.
Butler: Or, if you wish to change, I can show you to your room right now.
Samuel Manning: I'm good, but I could use a drink.
Samuel Manning: Which way is the tea room?
Astonishing. He looked passed out drunk in the car.
How could he possibly want another drink now?
Butler: Very well, sir. You'll find the tea room through the door on your left.
Butler: Other guests who arrived earlier are already settled there.
Butler: You can join them.
Sushil Sinha: I'll come with you.
Butler: What about you, Miss ...?
Amelia Baxter: Miss Baxter.
Amelia Baxter: I believe I shall freshen up in my room first.
Amelia Baxter: It has been a very long journey.
Butler: Of course, please follow me upstairs.
Butler: Here we are, Miss.
Butler: The "Elizabeth I Bedroom."
Butler: I hope it's to your liking.
He opens my room and lets me in.
At the same time, the driver arrives with my luggage.
He leaves them there and then excuses himself.
Butler: Well, it looks like you're all set.
Butler: Please join us in the dining room when you're ready.
I nod and take a look at my room.
It is a bit worn, but it still looks decent.
I should be quite comfortable here.
When I am ready, I head downstairs to the tea room.
Butler: Miss Baxter.
Butler: Almost everyone is here now.
He quickly introduces me to those I have not yet met.
Butler: Please make yourself at home.
Butler: Now, if you'll excuse me, I hear the car is back with the last guest.
He leaves me on my own.
I glance about the room.
Nearly everyone is gathered around Sushil Sinha.
He is in the midst of what sounds like yet another tedious story.
I am not eager to listen to that again.
On a chair, Samuel Manning sits alone with a glass in his hand.
I can't believe it.
He fell asleep again.
Well, I suppose I have no choice but to join the larger group.
But before I can move, the butler returns.
Butler: Mr Ted Harring!
The butler nearly shouts the name of the new guest.
He is a good-looking young man, but he appears unsure.
It is clear he is not in his natural element here.
I smile at him and, after some hesitation, he comes towards me.
Ted Harring: Nice to meet you, Miss Baxter. I am Ted Harring.
Amelia Baxter: Nice to meet you, Mr Harring.
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for him
Butler: Dinner is served. Please follow me to the dining room.
I sit down at the place with my name on it.
Then, a lady enters the room.
She is wearing expensive clothing.
Lady Claythorn: Welcome, everyone. My apologies for keeping you waiting.
Lady Claythorn: Now that we're all gathered, I'd like to express my gratitude once more.
Lady Claythorn: As you already know, you are here because of the heroic acts you've committed in the past.
Lady Claythorn: I've taken notice of these actions and felt it was my responsibility to extend a formal 'thank you.'
Lady Claythorn: I realize the invitation letter you received was somewhat vague, so let me clarify its contents now.
Lady Claythorn: My first gift to you is a stay at my manor.
Lady Claythorn: You'll be fully catered to, enjoying the most refined food, expertly prepared by my personal chef.
Lady Claythorn: During the three days we'll spend together, we'll also partake in various activities, which I'm sure you'll find enjoyable.
Lady Claythorn: My second gift is a sum of one thousand pounds, to be shared among you.
Lady Claythorn: This is my way of thanking those as selfless as yourselves, who help others without thought of reward.
Following her speech, our host settles back down in her chair.
Well said.
I join in the applause with the rest of the guests.
Lady Claythorn: Please no need to thank me. The food will be served, enjoy your meal.
The food arrives right after the speech.
The timing is perfect.
It seems I already know the persons next to me.
On my left is Mr Sinha.
And Ted Harring is on my right.
Menu Choice: Don't engage with anyone, it's unladylike
The dinner is over.
The host gave us the opportunity to meet again for drinks.
But I do not know, this has been quite a long day.
Perhaps I should simply go to bed.
In any case, I ought to retire to my room first.
Well, I am comfortably settled.
What should I do now?
Map Choice: Storage Room
I climb the stairs to the attic and arrive in a dimly lit hallway.
There are multiple doors, most of them lie in darkness.
As I move into the hallway, I hear something.
Older Man: Hello, is someone there?
Amelia Baxter: Hello...
Amelia Baxter: My name is Amelia Baxter.
Older Man: Nice to meet you, Miss Baxter.
Older Man: It's rare to meet someone up here.
Older Man: I am usually by myself.
Amelia Baxter: Nice to meet you too.
Amelia Baxter: I am sorry to ask,
Amelia Baxter: but who are you?
Older Man: Oh, where are my manners?
Older Man: I am the Lord of this Manor, of course.
Wait, what?
Amelia Baxter: I am sorry, Lady Claythorn didn't mention you.
Older Man: Lady Claythorn? You probably mean my daughter then.
Older Man: I suppose she likes having all the attention to herself.
Older Man: She must be relieved that I spend most of my time alone in my room here.
Amelia Baxter: You live here?
Older Man: Yes, it's rather uncommon, but I enjoy how peaceful it is.
Older Man: Plus, I believe I have the biggest room in the manor.
He points to the big door in front of the stairs.
Amelia Baxter: Right...
I don't know what to say. There is something wrong with all this.
Older Man: So my dear, were you looking for something in particular by coming here?
Amelia Baxter: Well, not really. I was mostly exploring your home.
Older Man: In that case, I would advise you not to linger here.
Older Man: There's not much to see in this old attic.
Older Man: You'll find more interesting rooms downstairs.
Alright, he probably wants to stay alone.
Amelia Baxter: Of course, I will continue visiting elsewhere.
Older Man: Thank you, my dear.
Older Man: Enjoy your stay.
Amelia Baxter: Thank you.
This was rather peculiar.
I don't think I should return here too soon.
Map Choice: Richard III Bedroom
I knock on the door, waiting for a response.
There's silence. No one replies.
I do not think it would be wise to simply enter someone's room like that.
They might return at any moment.
Map Choice: Meet the others in the billiard room
It appears that most guests have chosen to gather here.
Daniel Baldwin stands alone in the corner.
Ted Harring is at the bar with Samuel Manning.
A crowd has formed around Sushil Sinha.
He is likely monopolising the conversation.
Menu Choice: Go to the bar
Amelia Baxter: Good evening, Mr Harring.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Manning.
Ted Harring: Oh, hi Miss Baxter.
Ted Harring: Don't mind Mr Manning.
Ted Harring: I think he might have had one too many.
Yes, or perhaps ten too many.
Ted Harring: Would you like something to drink?
Ted Harring: We have port and sherry.
Amelia Baxter: That is not a wide selection.
Amelia Baxter: But I shall have a sherry, thank you.
Ted Harring: No problem. I'll pour one for myself as well.
He is trembling slightly while pouring the drinks.
Could he be a little drunk as well?
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for him
Menu Choice: Leave the room
Map Choice: Go to bed
It has been a long day.
I cannot stay up any longer.
It is time to go to bed.
After taking a bit of time to get ready, I can get into bed.
I have no problem falling asleep.
Despite the storm that raged all night, I managed to sleep rather well.
So, I take my time getting ready and then go downstairs to the dining room.
Some of the guests are already eating.
I take a plate at the breakfast buffet and then sit down in the same place at the table as yesterday.
Captain Sinha is there, but I do not feel like engaging in conversation with him.
It is too early for that.
After a while, Ted Harring joins me at the table.
Amelia Baxter: Hello, Mr Harring. How are you?
Ted Harring: Very well, thank you.
Amelia Baxter: I was wondering if everyone would join us on time.
Amelia Baxter: There are still a few people missing.
Amelia Baxter: For instance, I don't think we'll see Mr Manning anytime soon.
Amelia Baxter: He was so drunk yesterday that I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't show up before noon.
Right after saying those words, Samuel Manning steps into the room.
Displaying evident unease, he makes his way to the buffet and, with trembling hands, selects a plate.
He appears to still be drunk, or at least seriously hungover.
Amelia Baxter: Well, I spoke too soon. Here he is. And in such a state.
Amelia Baxter: How dreadful.
While I am watching Samuel Manning, the butler enters and discreetly shares a message with Lady Claythorn.
Her alarmed expression indicates the gravity of the news.
Rising, she approaches, pausing only when she reaches the doctor.
Lady Claythorn: Doctor Baldwin, I'm sorry to interrupt your breakfast, but would you mind coming with me?
Lady Claythorn: We need your assistance.
Without hesitation, Daniel Baldwin stands up.
Daniel Baldwin: Of course, I'll follow you.
For some reason, Ted Harring also stands up and follows them.
It seems I am left with Sushil Sinha.
Amelia Baxter: Good morning, Mr Sinha.
Sushil Sinha: Miss Baxter.
Menu Choice: What do you think of the other guests?
Sushil Sinha: I guess we can talk a bit about the other guests.
Sushil Sinha: Who in particular?
Menu Choice: What do you think of Rosalind Marsh?
Sushil Sinha: A discreet woman.
Sushil Sinha: She's stylishly dressed, but in a humble way.
Sushil Sinha: You can immediately tell she's at ease in these kinds of gatherings.
Menu Choice: What do you think of Samuel Manning?
Sushil Sinha: Ah yes, our intoxicated friend.
Sushil Sinha: There's not much to say that you haven't already noticed yourself.
I guess he's right about that.
Menu Choice: What do you think of Ted Harring?
Sushil Sinha: Mr Harring seems like a fine young fellow.
Sushil Sinha: But you've talked to him more than I have.
Sushil Sinha: You must have a more accurate opinion of him.
Amelia Baxter: That's true. Nevertheless, have you noticed anything specific about him?
Sushil Sinha: Well, I did notice that his clothes are a bit dated and worn.
Sushil Sinha: Either he doesn't care about his appearance, or he can't afford more recent clothing.
Sushil Sinha: I'll leave it to you to make your own judgment about that.
Suddenly, Lady Claythorn and the butler are back in the room.
Sushil Sinha: Lady Claythorn, what is happening?
The lady is visibly distressed.
Lady Claythorn: I'm sorry to announce such horrible news, everyone.
Lady Claythorn: It appears that Mr Moody passed away in his sleep last night.
The room instantly falls silent.
Sushil Sinha: Do we know what happened?
Lady Claythorn: Doctor Baldwin is examining him right now.
Lady Claythorn: He will likely tell us more later.
She then sits down in her chair.
Everyone looks shaken up.
Sushil Sinha: How terrible.
Amelia Baxter: Yes, such sad news.
We continue eating slowly in silence for a moment when the doctor enters the room.
Lady Claythorn: Doctor Baldwin, can you tell us more about what happened?
Daniel Baldwin: I can't say anything definitive for now.
Daniel Baldwin: But it's very likely a natural death, possibly triggered by an old wound from the war.
Daniel Baldwin: In any case, we need to call the authorities.
Lady Claythorn: Yes, of course.
Lady Claythorn: My butler will take care of it.
Daniel Baldwin: Very well.
We then continue eating in sad silence.
Nobody speaks much.
Lady Claythorn: Well, as I mentioned earlier, activities were planned for today.
Lady Claythorn: This morning, those who wished to were supposed to go on a hunt.
Lady Claythorn: A sad event has happened, but it's not a reason to remain idle.
Lady Claythorn: So, if no one objects, I propose that we continue according to what was planned.
A murmur of assent runs through the assembly.
Lady Claythorn: Excellent.
Lady Claythorn: Everything is ready for those who wish to join the hunt.
Lady Claythorn: I know most of you are probably not accustomed to this type of event.
Lady Claythorn: That's why our staff can lend you everything you'll need—clothes, guns—and they will also assist you throughout the event.
Lady Claythorn: Of course, you can choose to simply stay here.
Lady Claythorn: You can relax and enjoy the warmth of the house until the others return.
That's impressive.
People seem eager to move on really quickly.
Well, let them enjoy their game.
Obviously, I will stay here this afternoon.
I let everyone know that I am opting out of the hunt.
It turns out Rosalind Marsh is the only other one who made the same choice.
We agreed to meet shortly for luncheon in the tea room.
I should find her there a bit before noon.
Map Choice: Female Servants Room
I climb the stairs to the attic.
The room is filled with darkness.
I think I shouldn't venture here.
There's no reason for me to disturb Lord Claythorn any further,
at least for now.
So I turn back.
Map Choice: Queen Alexandra
I knock on the door.
Rosalind Marsh: Yes? Who's there?
Amelia Baxter: It's Amelia Baxter.
Rosalind Marsh: Oh, Mrs. Baxter, I'm really tired right now.
Rosalind Marsh: Can this wait until luncheon?
Amelia Baxter: Of course, sorry for bothering you.
Map Choice: George I Bedroom
I knock on the door, waiting for a response.
There's silence. No one replies.
Most people are out for the hunt, so I suppose I could try to enter the room anyway.
But it would not look good if I were caught.
What should I do?
Menu Choice: Let's go in. What's the worst that could happen?
I try to push the door open.
The door is locked.
Map Choice: Billiard room
The billiard room is empty right now.
I should leave.
Map Choice: Garden
A lovely garden.
I took a peaceful stroll through it.
Still, I notice nothing out of the ordinary.
It's almost time for lunch, I should go wait in the Tea Room.
I am the first to arrive, so I pick a table and wait for Rosalind Marsh.
I am seated comfortably, lost in my thoughts when she enters the room.
Amelia Baxter: Miss Marsh, would you like to join me?
Rosalind Marsh: Yes, thank you.
Amelia Baxter: It seems we haven't really had a chance to talk yet, right?
Menu Choice: What do you think of the other guests?
Rosalind Marsh: Oh, up until now, I've mostly kept to myself.
Rosalind Marsh: I haven't talked to many people.
Rosalind Marsh: I am seated next to Samuel Manning, but we haven't had a very deep conversation yet.
Rosalind Marsh: Our host is the only other person I've had any real exchange with.
Rosalind Marsh: But we stuck mostly to simple pleasantries.
Menu Choice: What do you think of Lady Claythorn
Rosalind Marsh: I only share a few words with the Lady of the house.
Rosalind Marsh: I tried to know more about the details of the Manor, the staff, that sort of things.
Rosalind Marsh: She was quite polite, but her responses were short and not very informative.
Rosalind Marsh: I hope I wasn't rude to her.
Menu Choice: What do you think of Samuel Manning
Rosalind Marsh: I usually don't like to spread gossip.
Rosalind Marsh: But in this case, I don't think it's a big secret.
Rosalind Marsh: I believe Samuel Manning is an alcoholic.
Rosalind Marsh: He was barely intelligible both at dinner yesterday and this morning.
Rosalind Marsh: Those were two pretty unpleasant meals for me.
Well, that's nothing I didn't already know.
Menu Choice: I want to talk about something else.
Menu Choice: What room are you in?
Rosalind Marsh: My room is named after "Queen Alexandra."
Rosalind Marsh: Like the queen mother, I believe.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this weather?
Rosalind Marsh: This night was dreadful, wasn't it?
Rosalind Marsh: I couldn't sleep at all.
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for her
Suddenly, a staff member walks in.
Young woman: Excuse me for interrupting, but do you ladies need some lunch?
Rosalind Marsh: That would be lovely, thank you.
After a few minutes, she returns with some plates.
As we eat, we chat about trivial matters.
When our lunch is over, Rosalind rises from her seat.
She lets out a painful cough.
Rosalind Marsh: I'm feeling rather poorly.
Rosalind Marsh: I think I will retire to my room.
Rosalind Marsh: Would you mind being left on your own?
Amelia Baxter: Not at all, please don't concern yourself.
Amelia Baxter: There is more than enough here to occupy me.
With the manor so quiet, I might seize the chance to explore unnoticed.
And perhaps I should call upon Rosalind Marsh later, to see how she is doing.
What should I do know?
Map Choice: Entrance Hall
A very nice great hall.
But it is totally empty.
Map Choice: Richard III Bedroom
The doctor left Thomas Moody's room open.
I guess he didn't think anyone would come to take a look.
I know I shouldn't have, but I couldn't resist.
Maybe I didn't believe it.
But here he lies, dead in his bed.
I try to look at him, but the emotion is overwhelming.
I can't stay here any longer.
I rush out of the room.
Map Choice: Go check on Rosalind Marsh
I knock on Rosalind Marsh's door.
Rosalind Marsh: Yes? Who is there?
Amelia Baxter: It is me again.
Amelia Baxter: I wanted to see how you were faring.
She slightly opens the door but stays inside.
Rosalind Marsh: Oh, Mrs Baxter, I am not feeling at all well.
Rosalind Marsh: Could it wait?
A harsh cough rakes her chest.
Rosalind Marsh: I am sorry.
Amelia Baxter: Are you quite all right?
Rosalind Marsh: Yes, it is nothing, really.
Rosalind Marsh: I am only a little under the weather.
She takes out her handkerchief and presses it to her mouth.
She tries to slip it quickly back into her pocket.
Yet I catch a glimpse of blood upon the linen.
She is worse than she would have me believe.
Rosalind Marsh: I should lie down now.
She is plainly uncomfortable.
But perhaps I could press her a little.
Menu Choice: Insist, something is clearly wrong here
Amelia Baxter: I am afraid it is important.
Amelia Baxter: Might you let me in? It will not take long.
Rosalind Marsh: Very well, do come in.
Rosalind Marsh: What can I do for you?
Amelia Baxter: Nothing, rather the reverse.
Amelia Baxter: I am sorry to intrude, but I noticed the blood on your handkerchief.
Amelia Baxter: I wondered whether there is anything I can do to help.
Rosalind Marsh: I suppose I could not have hidden it forever.
Rosalind Marsh: You see, I am suffering from a most serious disease.
Rosalind Marsh: One for which there is no known cure. Consumption.
Another racking cough takes her.
Amelia Baxter: I am so very sorry.
Amelia Baxter: When did you learn of it?
Rosalind Marsh: A couple of years ago.
Rosalind Marsh: And if I am to trust my doctor, I have perhaps a year at most.
Amelia Baxter: My goodness, how horrible.
Amelia Baxter: Is there anything at all I can do?
Rosalind Marsh: There is nothing to be done.
Rosalind Marsh: My doctor has prescribed a strong draught that I must take before bed.
Rosalind Marsh: It usually helps me to sleep.
Rosalind Marsh: At times I must take it during the day, which is why I am so often in my room, resting.
Rosalind Marsh: But you should go now. I shall try to sleep a little before dinner.
Rosalind Marsh: Thank you for your kindness.
Amelia Baxter: Of course. I shall go.
Rosalind Marsh: Thank you.
Map Choice: Henry IV Bedroom
I knock on the door, waiting for a response.
There's silence. No one replies.
There seems to be nobody here as well.
Menu Choice: It won't hurt to give it a try. Let's go in and find out.
I try to push the door open.
The door is locked.
Map Choice: Wait until the others come back
There's nothing else I want to do right now.
I should just lie down on my bed for a bit.
Suddenly, noises from the main entrance catch my attention.
I should investigate.
I observe the hunting party as they make their way into the house.
Lady Claythorn steps through the doorway first, her expression one of utter disbelief.
Following close behind are the butler and footman.
They carefully carry someone on an improvised stretcher.
Amelia Baxter: Oh my God! What happened!?
Amelia Baxter: Is that Doctor Baldwin? Is he injured?
Amelia Baxter: Oh no! Is he... dead?
Sushil Sinha: I'm sorry, dear, but he is.
Amelia Baxter: But... what happened?
Sushil Sinha: It was an accident.
Samuel Manning: I swear it was! I have no idea how I could have hit him.
Samuel Manning: I was aiming at a rabbit. I didn't even see him.
Everyone turns to him.
Amelia Baxter: You fool! You were probably too drunk, and that's why you hit him.
Amelia Baxter: You could barely walk this morning. Who gave you a gun?
Sushil Sinha: Please, there's no need to point fingers now. It's done.
Sushil Sinha: The police will handle it.
Sushil Sinha: Speaking of which, has anyone from the city arrived yet?
Amelia Baxter: No, not yet.
Amelia Baxter: We're still waiting for them.
Sushil Sinha: We should tell them to hurry.
Sushil Sinha: Lady Claythorn, where's the phone?
Lady Claythorn: I'll handle it.
She leaves the group, with the butler following closely behind.
The room falls silent.
Most eyes are on Sam Manning, filled with disdain.
Then, the hostess returns.
Lady Claythorn: I just spoke with the police. They aren't coming today.
Sushil Sinha: What!? Why not?
Lady Claythorn: They were on their way but encountered a huge tree blocking the road.
Lady Claythorn: They couldn't get past it.
Lady Claythorn: They said they'll be back tomorrow with assistance.
Amelia Baxter: But... what are we going to do with him until then?
Sushil Sinha: We'll move him to his bed for now.
Sushil Sinha: It's the best we can do under the circumstances.
Sushil Sinha: Anyone willing to help?
Ted Harring: I will.
I watch Captain Sinha and Ted Harring carry Doctor Baldwin to his room.
Now, the attention of everyone turns to Samuel Manning.
I realise no one has thought about restraining him in any way.
But it seems unnecessary as he is sitting on the stairs,
his gaze empty, apparently unaware of what is happening about him.
Lady Claythorn discreetly approaches her butler to converse with him, almost whispering.
Lady Claythorn: What should we do about him?
Lady Claythorn: We certainly can't allow him to wander freely.
Butler: It's difficult to say.
Butler: Ordinarily, this would be a matter for the police.
Butler: However, these are extraordinary circumstances, which leave me at a loss.
Rosalind Marsh: Indeed, but that shouldn't stop us from taking measures.
Rosalind Marsh: Our safety must be a priority.
Rosalind Marsh: While he may appear harmless now, it's uncertain if that will remain so.
Rosalind Marsh: Once the effect of the alcohol wanes and he grasps his situation, who knows how he'll respond.
Rosalind Marsh: There's a risk he could attempt to escape.
Amelia Baxter: Or, he might lash out and harm someone.
Rosalind Marsh: Precisely!
Rosalind Marsh: So we are in agreement, something needs to be done?
Everyone agrees, albeit silently.
Butler: The most sensible course would seem to be confining him to his room.
Butler: The doors are sufficiently robust, and considering his current condition, it's unlikely he'd manage to break free even if he tried.
Lady Claythorn: Yes, that seems like a prudent measure.
At that moment, Sushil Sinha makes his return from upstairs.
Ted Harring is not with him.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Harring needed to change, he'll join us shortly.
Lady Claythorn: Ah, Captain! It's good you're here.
Lady Claythorn: We've been deliberating over what action to take concerning Samuel Manning.
Sushil Sinha: I see.
Sushil Sinha: And what is your plan?
Lady Claythorn: We've decided to confine him to his chamber.
Lady Claythorn: At least until the authorities can take over.
Sushil Sinha: That does seem like the wisest approach.
He shifts his attention towards Samuel Manning.
Sushil Sinha: I hope you understand we're left with little choice right now.
Samuel Manning gives no sign of comprehension.
Samuel Manning: Choice? What choice?
Samuel Manning: What do you mean?
Sushil Sinha: You have to retire to your room for now.
Sushil Sinha: The door will be locked from the outside to ensure you don't get out.
Sushil Sinha: Is that clear?
Samuel Manning: Yes, of course...
Samuel Manning: I understand.
Sushil Sinha: Good, come with me, please.
The butler retrieves a set of keys from his pocket.
After sifting through them, he presents one to Mr Sinha.
Butler: Use this key to lock his room.
Sushil Sinha: Excellent, thank you.
Sushil Sinha: Now, Mr Manning, let's go shall we?
Samuel Manning offers a silent nod, rises, and follows Captain Sinha up the staircase.
His gaze betrays a mix of resignation and confusion.
We all watch the two men leave down the stairs.
Then an awkward silence fills the room.
Lady Claythorn: What a sad business.
Lady Claythorn: But, sadly, there is nothing else to be done at the moment.
Lady Claythorn: I suggest you all return to your rooms for now.
Lady Claythorn: You'll hear the gong when dinner is ready.
Before heading to my room, there is something I would like to understand.
I approach the butler.
Butler: Yes, Miss Baxter?
Amelia Baxter: I don't understand; how could you give a gun to someone so drunk?
Butler: I am so sorry, but he wasn't drunk when we talked this morning.
Butler: He was acting totally normally.
Butler: He probably got drunk during the day.
Butler: There was nothing I could have done.
Amelia Baxter: Right.
He did seem very drunk to me at breakfast, though.
I return to my room to change and collect my thoughts.
So much has happened today, it is overwhelming.
I use this brief respite to compose myself.
There is little time before dinner, so I could wait here,
or take the opportunity to have a private word with someone.
I do not think it would be wise to approach Captain Sinha,
nor Lady Claythorn.
And I should let Rosalind Marsh rest.
However, I do not believe I am taking too much of a risk by talking with Ted Harring.
Menu Choice: Try to talk to Ted Harring
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, may I come in?
Ted Harring: Come on in, Mrs. Baxter. The door is open.
Amelia Baxter: I'm sorry to intrude, but I believe we should talk.
Amelia Baxter: Something dangerous is happening here.
Ted Harring: What do you mean?
Amelia Baxter: Don't you find it strange that two different people died in the same place, from two different causes?
Ted Harring: Well, I don't know about Thomas Moody.
Ted Harring: But for the doctor's death, you said it yourself: Samuel Manning was probably drunk.
Ted Harring: That's tragic, but not really surprising.
Amelia Baxter: That's what I initially thought.
Amelia Baxter: However, I just spoke with the butler. He insisted that Samuel Manning was clear-minded when he handed him his gun.
Ted Harring: So, what, you think he staged the accident?
Ted Harring: He might've just drank too much during the hunt.
Amelia Baxter: Possibly, but it's still suspicious.
Amelia Baxter: I have other reasons to believe something is amiss here.
Amelia Baxter: Let's just say, I have a feeling.
Ted Harring: You can "feel" it?
Amelia Baxter: Don't dismiss what you don't understand, Mr Harring.
Amelia Baxter: But it's okay. I don't need you to believe me.
Amelia Baxter: I'm simply warning you to be cautious.
Ted Harring: Are you scared of Samuel Manning?
Amelia Baxter: Yes, but not just him.
Amelia Baxter: Others might be involved too.
Amelia Baxter: I don't think we can trust anyone fully.
Ted Harring: Yet, you seem to trust me.
Amelia Baxter: Well, I wouldn't put it that way.
Amelia Baxter: If someone were after me, I'd be defenseless. So, I need an ally.
Amelia Baxter: You seem capable of defending both of us if there's a direct confrontation.
Amelia Baxter: So, I chose to confide in you.
Amelia Baxter: It is dinner time.
Amelia Baxter: Not that I'm particularly hungry.
Amelia Baxter: But we should head downstairs regardless.
He nods in agreement.
Amelia Baxter: I believe we should continue this conversation later.
Amelia Baxter: If you agree, come see me in my room after dinner.
As I step into the dining room, a sombre ambience surrounds me.
The chairs where Daniel Baldwin and Thomas Moody usually sat are empty.
Samuel Manning is not here either, of course.
I settle into my familiar place, with Ted Harring to my right.
Lady Claythorn stands up to speak.
Lady Claythorn: Now that everyone is here, I want to express my deepest regret for what happened today.
Lady Claythorn: This isn't how I imagined our weekend.
Lady Claythorn: I don't believe any of us are in the mood for more entertainment.
Lady Claythorn: So, tomorrow morning, you'll receive your rewards.
Lady Claythorn: Afterward, we'll wait for the police to arrive.
Lady Claythorn: You're free to head home as soon as the officers give the all-clear.
Lady Claythorn: For now, enjoy your dinner.
Lady Claythorn: Drinks will be available in the billiard room afterwards, as they were yesterday.
The food is served shortly after the speech.
Yet, most of us have little appetite.
Ted Harring: Miss Baxter, I don't see Samuel Manning.
Ted Harring: Do you know where he might be?
Amelia Baxter: He's locked in his room.
Amelia Baxter: After you left, there was a debate about how to handle him.
Amelia Baxter: Ultimately, we decided it best to confine him to his room.
Amelia Baxter: He didn't resist.
Amelia Baxter: That's where he is now.
Amelia Baxter: It was agreed that his dinner would be served there.
We ate in silence.
After dinner, most people retired to their rooms.
I do not think many will join for a drink afterwards.
So I could also take advantage of the fact that the Manor is almost empty.
Or I could wait in my room for Ted Harring.
What should I do?
Map Choice: Entrance Hall
A very nice great hall.
But it is totally empty.
Map Choice: Tea room
There's no one here.
There's no reason to linger.
Map Choice: Dining Room
The dining area is currently unoccupied.
I shouldn't stay here.
Map Choice: Edward II Bedroom
The door stands slightly ajar.
I notice faint traces of blood on the floor.
Cautiously, I step inside and see Doctor Baldwin's body.
He is lying peacefully in his bed.
Unsure what I could do here, I decide to leave.
Map Choice: George I Bedroom
I knock on the door, waiting for a response.
There's silence. No one replies.
Should I try to enter anyway?
There's no need to wander the house further.
I should return to my room.
After a little while, someone knocks at my door.
Ted Harring: Miss Baxter?
Ted Harring: Are you here? It's Ted Harring.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, are you alone?
Ted Harring: I am.
Amelia Baxter: Come on in then.
Amelia Baxter: So, have you given any thought to what I told you?
Amelia Baxter: Do you agree that something isn't right?
Ted Harring: I'm not sure yet. But what happened is strange enough that we should take some precautions.
Amelia Baxter: I'm glad you agree.
Amelia Baxter: I've given this a lot of thought, and I believe if what I fear is true, Samuel Manning had help from someone else.
Ted Harring: Do you mean a guest? Or could someone from the staff be involved?
Amelia Baxter: I wouldn't rule anything out, but it seems less likely that the staff or Lady Claythorn would be implicated.
Amelia Baxter: Such an act would require a massive operation.
Amelia Baxter: No, a more plausible theory is that one or two individuals heard about the event and took the places of real guests to infiltrate the manor.
Ted Harring: But why would they do that?
Amelia Baxter: Well, it's rather obvious, isn't it?
Amelia Baxter: The prize money, of course.
Amelia Baxter: It was mentioned in the invitation letter that the prize will be given in bearer's bonds.
Ted Harring: Bearer's bonds?
Amelia Baxter: That's a note that you can exchange at the bank without having to prove your identity.
Amelia Baxter: So, it's almost as easy to use as cash.
Ted Harring: That's a lot of money hidden somewhere in the manor.
Ted Harring: So you think it could be a mere robbery?
Ted Harring: Why not just directly attack the manor?
Amelia Baxter: It's easier to enter incognito.
Amelia Baxter: First, observe and then discreetly eliminate potential threats.
Amelia Baxter: That's the most likely explanation I could think of.
Ted Harring: I suppose that's possible.
Ted Harring: But there's no way to determine who might be involved.
Amelia Baxter: Exactly.
Amelia Baxter: That's why I suggest we stay safely in our rooms tonight.
Amelia Baxter: Tomorrow morning, the first one of us to wake up should alert the other.
Amelia Baxter: Then we stick together the entire day until we can safely leave.
Amelia Baxter: What do you think?
Ted Harring: It sounds like a good plan.
Ted Harring: Let's do it.
Amelia Baxter: Great!
Amelia Baxter: Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
Ted Harring: Not really. About what?
Menu Choice: Tell me more about yourself.
Ted Harring: There isn't much to say about me.
Ted Harring: I was born and raised in Birmingham.
Ted Harring: I work there as a business associate.
Amelia Baxter: Interesting, in what type of business?
Ted Harring: Well, just regular sales.
Amelia Baxter: And do you sell anything in particular?
Ted Harring: A bit of everything, depending on the opportunities.
Amelia Baxter: You don't have a store then?
Ted Harring: No, no, it's nothing like that.
He seems uneasy.
He is probably ashamed of what he is doing.
I shouldn't push him further.
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for him
Amelia Baxter: I believe it's getting quite late.
Amelia Baxter: We ought to get some rest now.
Ted Harring: Of course, I'll see you tomorrow.
Unsurprisingly, I slept terribly.
At least it's the last day. All of this will be over soon.
Now I need to get my things ready and head to Ted Harring.
On my way to Ted's, the emptiness of the Manor hits me.
There is not a sound that can be heard.
It gives me a chill.
I stop in front of his door.
He is not responding.
I hope he is well.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Harring, are you there?
Ted Harring: I'm coming!
Finally, I was getting worried.
He opens the door for me and I enter.
Amelia Baxter: Mr Haring, I believe my hunch was right yesterday.
Amelia Baxter: Something strange is afoot.
Ted Harring: What do you mean?
Amelia Baxter: I haven't seen any staff members on my way here.
Amelia Baxter: At this hour, they should be busy with lighting fires, cleaning and setting up breakfast.
Amelia Baxter: Yet, I neither saw nor heard anyone.
Amelia Baxter: It's as silent as a graveyard in here.
Ted Harring: Are you sure it's not just because it's so early?
Amelia Baxter: I'm certain.
Amelia Baxter: I was up at the same time yesterday, and the house was bustling with activity.
Amelia Baxter: Something's not right, I assure you.
Ted Harring: Okay, if you say so.
Ted Harring: But how is that related to a robbery?
Amelia Baxter: I'm not so sure anymore that this is about a robbery.
Amelia Baxter: I have a feeling it could be something much worse.
He paused for a second there, he must have realised it's serious.
Ted Harring: Alright, we'd better investigate then.
And we started to look for others in the manor,
inspecting every room.
I let him choose where we were going,
even though his choices didn't always make much sense.
We searched the Manor extensively, but we didn't find much anything interesting.
Ted Harring insisted on taking an empty gun from the gun room.
I am not sure what he intends to do with it.
Tired and demoralised, we decided to take a break in the tea room.
We rested there until we heard a familiar voice.
Sushil Sinha: Is anyone here?
Ted Harring: Yes, Ted Harring. I'm here, and Amelia Baxter's with me.
Sushil Sinha: At last, living, breathing souls.
Sushil Sinha: I was starting to feel like I was in a ghost house.
Amelia Baxter: We feel the same. You're the first person we've encountered today as well.
Ted Harring: Do you have any idea what's going on?
Sushil Sinha: Nothing concrete. All I know is, I don't like it.
Sushil Sinha: People don't just vanish from their homes without reason.
Amelia Baxter: They certainly don't.
Sushil Sinha: And then there's the matter of the suspicious deaths.
Sushil Sinha: I could've dismissed them as bad luck yesterday, but now... I'm not so certain.
There is an awkward silence.
Ted Harring: By the way, did you check on Samuel Manning?
Ted Harring: You're the only one with the key to his room.
Sushil Sinha: No, not yet. I assumed he couldn't have gone far.
Sushil Sinha: But you're right, we should check on him.
Ted Harring: I think so too.
Ted Harring: We'll follow you.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Manning, are you there?
No response.
Sushil Sinha: Alright, I'm going in.
Without warning, he opens the door and enters.
We quickly follow him, but he attempts to stop us.
Sushil Sinha: Wait! Don't come in.
But we are already in.
There lies Samuel Manning, dead in his bed.
Blood is all over him.
I let out a gasp.
Sushil Sinha: Miss Baxter, please don't stay here.
Without a word, Sushil Sinha drags me out of the room.
Sushil Sinha: I regret letting you see that.
Sushil Sinha: You shouldn't have entered.
Amelia Baxter: Is... is he... dead?
Sushil Sinha: I'm afraid so.
Ted Harring: Are you certain?
Ted Harring: Shouldn't we check his pulse?
Ted Harring: Maybe... just maybe, there's a chance he's alive.
Sushil Sinha: I'm sorry, but it's too late.
Sushil Sinha: I've seen enough dead people to know. He's been gone for a long time.
Sushil Sinha: Likely since last night.
Amelia Baxter: Oh my God.
Ted Harring looks terribly distraught.
Looking less affected, Captain Sinha guides us back to the tea room.
Sushil Sinha: Miss Baxter, you should probably rest here for a little bit.
Sushil Sinha: I have something to check out, and I'll be back soon.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Harring, would you mind coming with me?
Ted Harring: Well, sure.
Ted Harring: I'll follow you.
Amelia Baxter: Please don't be long.
Sushil Sinha: Don't worry, this should only take a few minutes.
I sat there quietly, pondering what had happened, what I should do next.
After some time, they came back.
Amelia Baxter: You've been gone for a while. What happened?
Sushil Sinha: I'm afraid we haven't been able to find Miss Marsh.
Sushil Sinha: Her room was locked, so we forced it open.
Sushil Sinha: But it was all for naught, as it was empty.
Amelia Baxter: Well, what should we do now?
Sushil Sinha: You both seem a bit shaken up.
Sushil Sinha: That's not surprising, given what you've witnessed.
Sushil Sinha: It's easier for me.
Sushil Sinha: Sadly, I've seen my share of dead people.
Sushil Sinha: So I suggest you two rest for a bit while I continue to explore the manor.
Sushil Sinha: I'll be back soon.
I have no objection to that.
Ted Harring seems to want to say something, then changes his mind.
We waited in the tea room without exchanging any words for a short time.
Finally, Captain Sinha comes back.
Sushil Sinha: I believe I've looked absolutely everywhere now.
Sushil Sinha: There is no trace of anyone.
Sushil Sinha: I also tried to use the telephone, and it's not working.
Sushil Sinha: Thus, there is no way for us to call for help.
Sushil Sinha: The way I see it now, we don't have many options left.
Sushil Sinha: I believe we must leave this place.
Sushil Sinha: The longer we stay, the more at risk we are.
Amelia Baxter: But... shouldn't we wait for the police?
Amelia Baxter: They were expected today. They could arrive any moment.
Sushil Sinha: I wouldn't count on it.
Sushil Sinha: From what I gather, there's no evidence that the police were called yesterday.
Amelia Baxter: But Miss Claythorn said...
Amelia Baxter: She said...
Amelia Baxter: I see, you believe she never called.
Amelia Baxter: That the police have no idea about what's happened here.
Amelia Baxter: That she lied to us.
Sushil Sinha: That's the most logical explanation.
Sushil Sinha: No one was around when the phone calls were supposedly made.
Sushil Sinha: So, there's no way to verify if they actually happened.
Ted Harring: But why?
Ted Harring: Why would anyone do this?
Ted Harring: I don't understand what's happening.
Sushil Sinha: Neither do I.
Sushil Sinha: I've thought about it, and I have no clue why we were all invited here.
Sushil Sinha: I'm certain it wasn't to give us any money.
Sushil Sinha: In any case, all I know is we need to leave as soon as possible.
Leave? I can't leave.
Yet something doesn't feel right.
I have a terrible premonition about this place.
I can see it... burning.
Gosh, it's like I can smell it too.
What's happening to me? Am I losing my mind?
I know it makes no sense to go out right now, but everything in my body compels me to leave this place as fast as possible.
Menu Choice: Let's not take any chance and leave this place{{intuition}}
Amelia Baxter: You're right.
Amelia Baxter: I can't stay one more minute in this cursed place.
Sushil Sinha: Are you sure?
Sushil Sinha: It won't be an easy walk.
Amelia Baxter: I am certain.
Sushil Sinha: Very well, let's get ready before we leave then.
Sushil Sinha: I suggest we all put on our most comfortable shoes, warm clothing and leave everything else here.
Sushil Sinha: No need to be encumbered by our luggage. Hopefully, we will come back soon enough to retrieve it.
Sushil Sinha: Let's get ready and meet in the main hall in 15 minutes.
Sushil Sinha: Do you agree?
Amelia Baxter: Of course.
Ted Harring: Sounds good to me.
I rush to my room, grab what I need, and hurry down to the hall as fast as possible.
The others are already there.
Captain Sinha has a large coat and sturdy boots with him.
Ted Harring, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have changed his clothes at all.
Sushil Sinha: All right, if everyone is ready, let's set out.
We then proceed to exit the house, leaving its impressive shadow behind us.
We've been walking for a couple of miles already.
I am struggling to keep up but, besides that, everything is going smoothly.
Maybe too smoothly.
I stop to take a brief break.
As I catch my breath, I look at the forest surrounding us.
Then...
Amelia Baxter: Captain, could you come and see something?
Sushil Sinha: Of course, what is it?
He retraces his steps to my level, while Ted Harring continues walking ahead.
Amelia Baxter: Can you look over there, behind that huge oak tree?
Amelia Baxter: I thought I saw something.
Amelia Baxter: I might be imagining things, but it looked like a person.
Sushil Sinha: I can spot the tree but see no one.
Amelia Baxter: I don't see it anymore, but it was definitely there a second ago.
Amelia Baxter: I'm sure of it.
Sushil Sinha: Alright, I'll go and check quickly.
Without hesitation, he rushes towards the large tree ahead.
A gunshot stops him in his tracks.
For a brief moment he manages to keep standing up.
He turns back towards me.
There is blood on his hands.
His face usually emotion less now shows panic, and pain.
He tries to take a step in my direction, but collapses on the ground.
When I realise what is happening, I quickly decide I can't stay here for long.
So I leave the Captain behind and start to run as fast as I can.
I try to catch up with Ted Harring, but he is already so far away that I can't even see him.
He didn't even pretend to wait for us.
I go as fast as I can but I don't see Ted Harring until I reach the town.
I head straight to the police station and there he is.
When I enter, he looks embarrassed to see me.
Probably feeling the weight of the guilt of leaving me to an uncertain fate.
But I am glad he made it anyway.
I hug him and tell him about Captain Sinha.
He replies that officers are on their way to Claythorn Manor.
We wait for them for a long time.
They come back only to confirm what we already knew.
Sushil Sinha has succumbed to his injuries.
There is no one alive at the manor.
In addition to Samuel Manning, Thomas Moody, and Daniel Baldwin, they've also found Rosalind Marsh's body.
She has been stabbed to death and is lying somewhere in the attic.
However, they have found no trace of Lady Claythorn and her staff.
You've made it!
And you've managed to save one person with you.
That's not bad, and you could stop there.
Not everybody needs a happy ending.
And this one is as good as any.
So it's up to you to just stop,
Or to keep playing.
