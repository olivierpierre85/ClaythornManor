Chapter: The Arrival
Character: Ted Harring
Butler: Welcome Sir.
Ted Harring: Hello, I'm Ted Harring. I've been invited by Lady Claythorn.
Butler: Yes, of course Mr Harring.
Butler: Welcome to Claythorn Manor.
Butler: I am afraid you won't have time to change right now.
Butler: Everyone is already there, and dinner will be ready very soon.
Butler: If you'll follow me into the tea room, you can join the rest of the party for some drinks.
Well, it's not as if I have multiple changes of clothes anyway. So, I follow him.
As I step into the room, the butler loudly introduces me.
Butler: Mr Ted Harring!
Everyone turns their head towards me.
Some people nod in my direction, while others barely acknowledge my presence.
From afar, the butler provides me with a brief introduction to each guest.
Butler: The older man talking is from India, and his name is Sushil Sinha.
Butler: He is in conversation with Rosalind Marsh...
Butler: .. and with Daniel Baldwin. The man with the glasses.
Butler: Don't be alarmed by the man in the mask.
Butler: He is a war veteran named Thomas Moody.
Butler: The man sitting on the couch, looking rather exhausted is Samuel Manning.
Butler: The older lady in the corner of the room is Amelia Baxter.
Ted Harring: I don't see our host in the room.
Butler: Lady Claythorn is still busy at the moment.
Butler: You'll meet her at dinner.
After this introduction, he leaves me and goes to stand in the corner of the room.
Most of the guests are already engaged in conversation.
However, Amelia Baxter and Samuel Manning are alone.
They seem more approachable than the rest.
Menu Choice: Talk to Samuel Manning
I am heading towards the older man.
He holds an empty glass in his hand. His gaze is empty.
Ted Harring: Hello sir, how are you?
Samuel Manning: (Snore...)
He reeks of booze, and he is deeply asleep. Talking to him is useless.
Menu Choice: Talk to Amelia Baxter
I am approaching the middle-aged woman.
Ted Harring: Nice to meet you, Miss Baxter. I am Ted Harring.
Amelia Baxter: Nice to meet you, Mr Harring.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this weather?
Amelia Baxter: Well, it is not very original to ask about such things when meeting someone new.
Amelia Baxter: But it is true that this is not your average rain. It looks more like a dangerous storm to me.
Amelia Baxter: And since we are basically in the middle of nowhere, that's reason enough to be a little nervous I suppose.
Menu Choice: Tell me more about yourself.
Amelia Baxter: Oh, where to begin? I suppose I'm just an old woman who keeps herself busy.
Amelia Baxter: I tend to my garden and brew herbal remedies,
Amelia Baxter: and I usually keep to myself, except for the séances that I frequently organise.
Ted Harring: Séances? You mean like talking to the dead?
Amelia Baxter: Well, simply put, yes. But there's more to it than that, of course.
Ted Harring: I've never been to one of those... séances. How does that work?
Amelia Baxter: There isn't just one way of doing it.
Amelia Baxter: Personally, I usually ask people to bring items that belonged to their loved ones who have passed.
Amelia Baxter: Through these objects, I am able to form a bond with the soul of the deceased.
Amelia Baxter: Then, they communicate with me. Sometimes it's just a whisper, barely audible.
Amelia Baxter: Other times, I can see them clearly, just as I see you now.
Amelia Baxter: And on rare occasions, they can take over my body and speak directly to their loved ones through me.
Ted Harring: You mean... like being possessed?
Amelia Baxter: Yes, but don't worry, there's nothing unholy about it.
Amelia Baxter: It only lasts for a few moments, and I always regain full control immediately after.
Still... that doesn't make me feel at ease.
Menu Choice: Why were you invited here?
Amelia Baxter: I was invited here because of something I did a couple of years ago.
Amelia Baxter: You might actually remember the event. It was in all the papers at the time.
Amelia Baxter: You see, with my talent, I am sometimes able to help people who desperately need it.
Amelia Baxter: One day, a young couple came to see me.
Amelia Baxter: Their only son, not even five years old, had been kidnapped.
Amelia Baxter: The police had no clues about what might have happened.
Amelia Baxter: Desperate, they sought my help.
Amelia Baxter: Right away, I could tell the child was still alive but in great danger.
Amelia Baxter: I saw him with a specific individual whom I described to the couple.
Amelia Baxter: They were able to identify her immediately.
Amelia Baxter: She was an old family friend who often visited their house.
Amelia Baxter: Nobody had suspected her until that point.
Amelia Baxter: But it turned out I was right. The child was indeed with her.
Amelia Baxter: She was arrested and the boy was safely returned to his parents.
Amelia Baxter: Since they were prestigious members of the nobility, a duke and duchess, the story was prominent in the press.
Amelia Baxter: My popularity grew quite a lot after that.
Ted Harring: Wait, I don't understand.
Ted Harring: How did you know the child was in danger?
Ted Harring: You can also communicate with people who are still alive?
Amelia Baxter: In a sense yes.
Amelia Baxter: Like I said, there is more to my gift than simply speaking with the dead.
Amelia Baxter: I can also sense if someone's life is at risk.
Amelia Baxter: Some say it is because when someone is close to the other world, we can sense them almost like they are already there.
Amelia Baxter: But for myself, I think it's something else entirely.
Amelia Baxter: I believe I can only talk to the dead.
Amelia Baxter: So when I can sense someone who is still alive. It means to me that there is a version of them that is not.
Amelia Baxter: I am not sure if you understand what I mean.
Ted Harring: I don't know.
Ted Harring: You mean someone can be dead and alive at the same time?
Amelia Baxter: Yes. I believe some version of the person died in another realm of existence.
Amelia Baxter: Then they came back to help a version of them who is still alive.
Amelia Baxter: I am sorry. That must sound like nonsense to you.
Amelia Baxter: Forget I said anything. I get carried away sometimes.
Amelia Baxter: But tell me. Why were you invited yourself?
So I tell her my story.
Amelia Baxter: Oh how interesting! I assumed most people were here because of something they did during the war.
Ted Harring: It would have been difficult for me. I was but sixteen when the war ended.
Amelia Baxter: Really? I thought you were older.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this place?
Amelia Baxter: Such a magnificent house right?
Amelia Baxter: Even if the style is not very recent, it still possesses a great deal of charm.
Amelia Baxter: You don't see a lot of that type of place anymore.
Amelia Baxter: The only problem is I don't see a lot of help for a house this big.
Amelia Baxter: And I don't think money is a problem.
Amelia Baxter: Lady Claythorn couldn't possibly give away so much money if she lacked the means.
Amelia Baxter: More likely, she couldn't find enough people to come live here.
Amelia Baxter: It has become very hard to recruit good help since the war.
Amelia Baxter: And it must be especially difficult when you are so far away from a city.
Amelia Baxter: Even in London, some of my neighbors are struggling finding employees.
Amelia Baxter: In any case, she should have made more of an effort for this weekend.
Amelia Baxter: I hope we won't suffer any inconvenience because of this.
Okay. I would not have thought of that.
She seems in her element here.
Am I the only one in here who has never had a butler waiting on him?
Menu Choice: How old are you?
Amelia Baxter: I beg your pardon?
Amelia Baxter: Are you truly asking me that? Were you raised in a barn?
Amelia Baxter: Only a person without any social skills would ask such a question of a respectable lady.
I mutter an apology and quickly change the subject.
Menu Choice: What do you think of the other guests?
Amelia Baxter: I've just met them. So I can't say I know a lot yet.
Amelia Baxter: All I know is that this guy over there ...
She points at Sushil Sinha.
Amelia Baxter: ... is monopolising the conversation.
Amelia Baxter: And he is very noisy too.
Amelia Baxter: It's not very tactful if you ask me.
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for her
Menu Choice: Stand awkwardly in the corner
What is that? A gong?
Butler: Dinner is served. Please, follow me to the dining room.
Everyone takes a seat at the spot labelled with their names.
As I observe each person, Lady Claythorn makes her entrance into the room.
She looks younger than I had imagined.
I don't know why, but I pictured an elderly, bored lady. Yet she looks nothing like that.
Her clothes, which are the most impressive of anyone's in the room, make her status clear.
She proceeds to take her seat at the table.
Lady Claythorn: Welcome, everyone. My apologies for keeping you waiting.
Lady Claythorn: Now that we're all gathered, I'd like to express my gratitude once more.
Lady Claythorn: As you already know, you are here because of the heroic acts you've committed in the past.
Lady Claythorn: I've taken notice of these actions and felt it was my responsibility to extend a formal 'thank you.'
Lady Claythorn: I realize the invitation letter you received was somewhat vague, so let me clarify its contents now.
Lady Claythorn: My first gift to you is a stay at my manor.
Lady Claythorn: You'll be fully catered to, enjoying the most refined food, expertly prepared by my personal chef.
Lady Claythorn: During the three days we'll spend together, we'll also partake in various activities, which I'm sure you'll find enjoyable.
Lady Claythorn: My second gift is a sum of one thousand pounds, to be shared among you.
Lady Claythorn: This is my way of thanking those as selfless as yourselves, who help others without thought of reward.
Following her speech, our host settles back down in her chair.
After her speech, everyone appears pleased.
A few of the guests begin to express their appreciation to the host.
Lady Claythorn: Please, there's no need to thank me.
Lady Claythorn: The food will be served shortly.
Lady Claythorn: Enjoy your meal.
At that moment, the butler enters the room, accompanied by the footman.
They begin to serve the first dish and pour drinks for everyone.
The mood in the room gradually relaxes, and the sound of various conversations fills the space.
I turn my attention to the guests seated next to me.
I find myself sitting between Amelia Baxter and Daniel Baldwin.
Menu Choice: Talk to Daniel Baldwin
Ted Harring: Hello. I am Ted Harring.
Daniel Baldwin: Hi Mr Harring, I am doctor Daniel Baldwin.
Ted Harring: Nice to meet you doctor.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this weather?
Daniel Baldwin: A dreadful storm, if you ask me.
Daniel Baldwin: I don't know what's planned for tomorrow, but I hope it doesn't involve leaving this house.
Menu Choice: Tell me more about yourself.
Daniel Baldwin: I am the chief physician at St. Margaret's Hospital.
Daniel Baldwin: It's a charity hospital for those in need.
Daniel Baldwin: Before that, I worked a bit all over the place.
Daniel Baldwin: I also served in the army several times, including the last one.
Daniel Baldwin: That one was the worst, of course.
Menu Choice: Why were you invited here?
Daniel Baldwin: Well, I recently celebrated my ten years at St. Margaret's.
Daniel Baldwin: Not many people stay that long at this type of institution.
Daniel Baldwin: Usually, doctors stay for a few years to build a reputation, then move on to a more luxurious practice.
Daniel Baldwin: Lady Claythorn must have understood the sacrifice I've made, hence the reward.
Daniel Baldwin: Not that I consider it a sacrifice, of course.
Daniel Baldwin: I love my job and wouldn't change it for the world.
Daniel Baldwin: Still, it's always nice to receive some recognition.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this place?
Daniel Baldwin: It's a nice house.
Daniel Baldwin: But I can't say much more about it.
Daniel Baldwin: I'm not used to visiting such places.
Daniel Baldwin: This is the first time I've been invited to a grand mansion as a guest and not as a doctor.
Daniel Baldwin: The truth is, my job doesn't pay that much.
Daniel Baldwin: Nevertheless, I'm content with my small apartment.
Daniel Baldwin: I wouldn't want anything this big; it must be such a hassle to manage.
Ted Harring: So you're not accustomed to having a butler and footmen around?
Daniel Baldwin: No, I can't say that I am.
Well, that's rather comforting.
Menu Choice: How old are you?
Daniel Baldwin: I'm 39 years old. Why do you ask?
Ted Harring: Actually, I'm not sure.
Menu Choice: What room are you in?
Daniel Baldwin: I'm staying in the Edward II room.
Menu Choice: What do you think of the other guests?
Daniel Baldwin: Oh, I haven't talked to many people so far.
Daniel Baldwin: I think the only person I've heard speak is Mr Sinha.
Daniel Baldwin: And by "heard," I really just mean heard.
Daniel Baldwin: Because I don't think I was able to contribute anything to the conversation.
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for him
Menu Choice: Eat in silence, like a sociopath
The dinner comes to an end.
The host explains that we can continue our discussion and enjoy drinks in the billiard room, or, for those tired from the journey, we can simply retire for the night.
Since I haven't seen my room yet, I should probably head there first.
I ask the footman to show me the way.
The footman escorts me up the grand staircase, leading me to the first floor.
Footman: Here you are, sir.
Footman: You've been assigned the "William The Conqueror" room.
I step into the bedroom.
It's more spacious than my apartment, and more luxurious than I could have ever imagined.
Footman: I hope the room suits your taste.
Ted Harring: This is... this is good, yes. Thank you.
The footman exits the room.
I look around in disbelief.
After a while, I unpack my modest luggage.
It does not take long. So, what should I do now?
Map Choice: Scullery
I was on my way to the basement when a young maid stopped me.
Young woman: Hello Sir, may I help you?
Ted Harring: Oh, don't mind me. I'm just taking a look around.
Young woman: I'm sorry, but the basement is off-limits to guests.
Young woman: However, there are plenty of rooms upstairs that you can explore.
Ted Harring: Of course, thank you.
Map Choice: Tea room
There is nobody here.
No need to stay any longer.
Map Choice: Library
It's a very nice library. But what am I doing here?
I can barely read.
There is an open book on a small table.
"A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain."
Yeah, I'm not reading that.
I should probably look elsewhere.
Map Choice: Entrance Hall
It's certainly an impressive entrance hall.
Nobody is here.
Map Choice: Garden
I reach the great hall and prepare to open the door.
However, the weather is so bad that only a madman would venture out now.
I'd be better off doing something else at the moment.
Map Choice: Dining Room
The dining room is empty at the moment.
I shouldn't stay here.
Map Choice: Meet the others in the billiard room
Except for Amelia Baxter, everyone from dinner is in this room.
I recognise Doctor Baldwin sitting alone in a chair.
There's also an array of alcohol near the bar.
The remainder of the guests are clustered together, with Sushil Sinha leading the conversation.
The butler stands silently in a corner near them.
Menu Choice: Talk to Daniel Baldwin
Ted Harring: Hello Doctor.
Daniel Baldwin: Mr Harring.
Menu Choice: You don't have anymore questions for him
Tutorial: You've selected a choice that was in dark.
Tutorial: That means you've already made that choice before.
Tutorial: No need to worry — there's nothing wrong with wanting to retrace your steps.
Tutorial: However, you should know that if there were other choices to be made afterwards, you've already explored them all as well.
Tutorial: To explain, let's take a simple example: imagine a question such as "Do you like apples?"
Tutorial: If you answer "no", then the conversation ends there.
Tutorial: But if you choose "yes", a new question appears: "Do you prefer red or green apples?"
Tutorial: In that case, the "no" will turn dark once you've chosen it once.
Tutorial: But the "yes" option from the first question won't turn dark until you've also selected both "red apples" and "green apples".
Tutorial: I hope that makes things clearer.
Menu Choice: Go to the bar to have a drink
I approach the bar.
Samuel Manning is there.
Ted Harring: Hello sir.
Samuel Manning: ...
The man stares at me but makes no sound.
Thomas Moody: Don't mind him, he seems to be totally out of it.
I am startled by the man who approaches me.
He wears one of those masks I've seen on wounded soldiers from the war.
They were so badly injured that they have to hide their faces.
He pretends not to notice my surprise and keeps on talking.
Thomas Moody: He was already asleep when I arrived. It is impressive he still manages to be here.
Thomas Moody: I was sitting next to him at dinner and it was impossible to get him to say anything coherent.
Thomas Moody: He could eat, though. You can tell he is used to functioning like this. Poor fellow.
Thomas Moody: Anyway, I am Thomas Moody.
Ted Harring: Ted Harring, how do you do.
Thomas Moody: Nice to meet you, Mr Harring. I suppose you are here for a drink.
Thomas Moody: The choice is rather restricted I am afraid. There's only Sherry or Port.
Thomas Moody: But luckily, I've come prepared.
Before I can say anything, he reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a flask.
Then he starts pouring me a glass of what looks like whisky.
Thomas Moody: You'll probably enjoy this more.
Well, I can't really say no to that.
Ted Harring: Thanks. Cheers.
Thomas Moody: Cheers, Mr Harring. Now if you don't mind, I'll see what this group is talking about.
He joins the group of people talking.
Menu Choice: Approach the large group of people
I walk towards the main group in the room.
Thomas Moody, Rosalind Marsh and Lady Claythorn are listening to the older Indian man.
Even the butler, who is standing on the corner next to them looks very interested in what is being said.
I join them.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Harring.
Sushil Sinha: I was just telling everyone here a story.
Sushil Sinha: Where was I?
Sushil Sinha: Oh Right.
Sushil Sinha: It was in June of 1900, so some of you might remember.
Sushil Sinha: In China, a group of rebels, called the "Boxers," had taken up arms against foreign presence in their country.
Sushil Sinha: They were a group of mostly peasants, poorly armed.
Sushil Sinha: We called them "Boxers" because of their use of martial arts in their fights.
This appears to be a long story.
If I stay, I might be stuck here for a while.
Menu Choice: Continue to listen anyway
Sushil Sinha: They managed to surround the Europeans and Japanese in the "International Legations" quarter, in China's capital, Beijing.
Sushil Sinha: There, the besieged did their best to resist the Chinese assaults, but it was obvious to everyone that they wouldn't last very long.
Sushil Sinha: In order to break the siege and rescue their compatriots, the largest foreign nations formed expeditions to help lift the siege of Beijing.
Sushil Sinha: I was part of the most important one, and the only successful one: The "Gaselee Expedition," named after Alfred Gaselee, the British expedition leader.
Sushil Sinha: It was a mish-mash of troops from eight different countries: Japan, The British Empire, The United States, France, Russia, German Empire, Italy, and Austria-Hungary.
Sushil Sinha: As an Indian officer, I was obviously part of the British army.
Sushil Sinha: We first landed in the old Chinese capital of Tianjin.
Sushil Sinha: Then we marched from there to reach Beijing, and rescue the civilians besieged there, as well as people from previous expeditions.
Sushil Sinha: The journey was a total nightmare.
Sushil Sinha: We endured a march of almost a hundred miles, where we were under constant attacks from Chinese troops.
Sushil Sinha: If that wasn't bad enough, some poorly led and confused soldiers, notably from the French army, often ended up shooting at their allies.
Sushil Sinha: But the worst part was the scorching heat.
Sushil Sinha: Even my fellow Indian soldiers were not immune to it, and many died of sunstroke.
Sushil Sinha: By the time we reached Beijing, our expedition of 20,000 soldiers was reduced to 10,000.
Sushil Sinha: By that time, the soldiers were angry, tired, and restless.
Sushil Sinha: They had started to commit such acts that I can't even repeat here.
Sushil Sinha: I was expecting the exactions of the Japanese and the Russians, who were known for their ruthlessness.
Sushil Sinha: But in the end, our proud "civilized" European nations fared no better.
Sushil Sinha: The final assault of the besieged was also an example of a lack of discipline among the soldiers and their commanders.
Sushil Sinha: Each country was supposed to attack a different gate of the city.
Sushil Sinha: But the Russians were not happy with their assigned choice of gate.
Sushil Sinha: So they woke up early and assaulted the closest gate to the legation quarters, where the Americans were supposed to be.
Sushil Sinha: They wanted to be the first army to reach the defenders, and so claim the glory of having liberated the city by themselves.
Sushil Sinha: Bloody fools.
Sushil Sinha: Luckily, in the end, we managed to conquer Beijing without too much trouble.
Sushil Sinha: We even entered the Imperial City and routed out the Empress.
Sushil Sinha: It was an undeniable victory, but the price paid was high.
Sushil Sinha: Afterwards, we stayed and occupied the city.
Sushil Sinha: To compensate themselves, soldiers went on a looting frenzy.
Sushil Sinha: Sadly, people in the British army also took part in it.
Sushil Sinha: But not in the same outrageous manner as other nations.
Sushil Sinha: At least, looting on the part of British troops was carried out in the most orderly fashion.
Sushil Sinha: We held loot auctions every day except Sunday in front of the main gate to the British Legation.
Sushil Sinha: It was the best way to compensate for the loss of our compatriots who had suffered the siege for three months.
Sushil Sinha: There was no way around it, I'm afraid.
Sushil Sinha: Well, in any case, that was my first campaign as a captain.
Sushil Sinha: And I do not regret it.
Sushil Sinha: I stayed a few more months in China to ensure the peaceful transition.
Sushil Sinha: In the end, my commanders were really pleased with me.
Sushil Sinha: So, I got to go to London to lead a training regiment near London.
Sushil Sinha: That was very rare for someone of Indian descent.
Sushil Sinha: In any case, that's why I live in England today.
Wait, that was the original question?
Why he is living in England?
That sure took long enough.
Menu Choice: Have another drink
I really don't feel comfortable here.
Perhaps another drink will help me relax.
So, I decide to go back to the bar and pour myself a sherry.
Menu Choice: Leave the room
I don't feel like staying in this room.
Map Choice: Portrait Gallery
That's a creepy portrait gallery.
I don't recognize anyone, so I guess these are people from the Claythorn family.
Map Choice: Servant Stairs
I entered a hidden space that is clearly meant for servants.
It's narrow TODO
Map Choice: Meet the others in the billiard room
Tutorial: You've selected a place you've already visited — at least during the same period.
Tutorial: If you didn't notice, the text appeared in a darker tone.
Tutorial: No need to worry — there's nothing wrong with revisiting the same location.
Tutorial: But on a map, if a place name appears in dark, you're unlikely to find anything new there.
Tutorial: I hope that helps you save some time.
I am back in the Billiard Room.
Menu Choice: Leave the room
I don't feel like staying in this room.
Map Choice: Go to sleep
It's getting quite late now.
Going back to my room is probably the best thing to do.
It's been a long day and I'm exhausted from the trip.
So I change and get directly into bed.
Almost instantly, I fall asleep.
You don't wake up.
You have died during the night.
It's unfair, I know.
You don't think that you have done anything wrong.
And you probably haven't.
But sometimes, people die without knowing why.
Don't worry, you'll have more chances to change the fate of this character.
You can start again now. Ideally, you've learned something that will help you in your next attempts.
But perhaps you haven't learned anything.
In that case, try to look at the story from a different perspective.
This story isn't about just one hero.
You'll get to play as different characters.
And you must.
Because otherwise, you'll never uncover the whole truth about what happened that weekend at Claythorn Manor.
