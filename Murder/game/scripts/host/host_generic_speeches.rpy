  Welcome, everyone. My apologies for keeping you waiting. 
  
  Now that we are all gathered here, I would like to express my gratitude once again.

  As you're already aware, you are all here because of the heroic acts you've committed in the past.

  I took notice of these actions and felt it was my responsibility to extend a formal 'thank you.'

  I realize the invitation letter you received was somewhat vague, so allow me to clarify its contents now.

  My first gift to you is this stay at my manor. 
  
  You will be fully catered to, enjoying the most refined food expertly prepared by my personal chef.

  During the three days we will spend together, we'll also partake in various activities which I am sure you will find enjoyable.

  My second gift is a sum of eight thousand pounds, to be shared among you. 
  
  This is my way of thanking those as selfless as yourselves, who help others without thought for reward.

  Following her speech, our host then settled back down in her chair.

    Well, as I told you before, activities were planned for the day.

    This morning those who wished were supposed to go on a hunt.

    It's a sad affair that has happened, but it's not a reason to stay here doing nothing.

    So, if nobody disagrees, I propose that we continue according to what was planned.

    Excellent.

    Everything is ready for those who wish to join the hunt. 
    
    I know most of you are probably not accustomed with this type of event.

    That's why our staff can lend you everything you will need, clothes, the guns. And they will also assist you during the whole event.

    But of course, you can decide to just stay here.

    You can relax and enjoy the warmth of the house until the others return.
