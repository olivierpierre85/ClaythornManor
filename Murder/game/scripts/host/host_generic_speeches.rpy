    Welcome, everyone. My apologies for keeping you waiting. 
    
    Now that we're all gathered, I'd like to express my gratitude once more.

    As you already know, you are here because of the heroic acts you've committed in the past.

    I've taken notice of these actions and felt it was my responsibility to extend a formal 'thank you.'

    I realize the invitation letter you received was somewhat vague, so let me clarify its contents now.

    My first gift to you is a stay at my manor. 
    
    You'll be fully catered to, enjoying the most refined food, expertly prepared by my personal chef.

    During the three days we'll spend together, we'll also partake in various activities, which I'm sure you'll find enjoyable.

    My second gift is a sum of eight thousand pounds, to be shared among you. 
    
    This is my way of thanking those as selfless as yourselves, who help others without thought of reward.

    Well, as I mentioned earlier, activities were planned for today.

    This morning, those who wished to were supposed to go on a hunt.

    A sad event has happened, but it's not a reason to remain idle.

    So, if no one objects, I propose that we continue according to what was planned.

    Excellent.

    Everything is ready for those who wish to join the hunt. 
    
    I know most of you are probably not accustomed to this type of event.

    That's why our staff can lend you everything you'll need—clothes, guns—and they will also assist you throughout the event.

    Of course, you can choose to simply stay here.

    You can relax and enjoy the warmth of the house until the others return.
