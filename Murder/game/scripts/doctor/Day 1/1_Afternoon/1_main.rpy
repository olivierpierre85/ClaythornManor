    Anxiety hits me harder than usual.

    I haven't been away this long in years. It feels off, but there's no turning back.

    Not with so much money at stake.

    I'll manage. I always do.

    My gaze lands on the bag. I pause. The thought crosses my mindâ€”it could help. It always does. 
    
    But it's a mistake, and I know it.

    I don't want to start wrong. Not this time. Something tells me I'll need my wits about me all weekend.

    I think it through, weigh it all, and still reach for the bag.

    I am seated at the front of the car.

    I tried to keep the conversation going for a while but it fazed out very quickly.

    Rosalind Marsh seems to be more of the quiet type, and beside, she still seems uneasy to be seated with the former soldier.

    She keeps looking at the window, averting his gaze as much as possible.

    Thomas Moody doesn't seem to mind. He must be used to this kind of treatment. 

    In any case, in remains silent, I don't know if it's by compassion for Miss Marsh or if that's just his nature.

    So after a while we all retreated into a silent contemplation of the landscape.

    I glance behind me every to check on the other, when I notice the driver was looking at me.

    When he realize I can see him, he quickly turn back to stare at the road.

    Am I imagining things or is he blushing?
