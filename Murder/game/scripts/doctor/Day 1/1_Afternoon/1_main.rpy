    Anxiety hits me harder than usual.

    I haven't been away this long in years. It feels off, but there's no turning back.

    Not with so much money at stake.

    I'll manage. I always do.

    My gaze lands on the bag. I pause. The thought crosses my mindâ€”it could help. It always does. 
    
    But it's a mistake, and I know it.

    I don't want to start wrong. Not this time. Something tells me I'll need my wits about me all weekend.

    I think it through, weigh it all, and still reach for the bag.

    We are all shocked by the mask covering most of his face.

    A "broken face" from the war.

    I am seated at the front of the car.

    I tried to keep the conversation going for a while, but it fizzled out rather quickly.

    Rosalind Marsh seems to be more of the quiet type, and besides, she still seems uneasy about being seated with the former soldier.

    She keeps looking out of the window, avoiding his gaze as much as possible.

    Thomas Moody doesn't seem to mind. He must be accustomed to this kind of treatment. 

    In any case, he remains silent. I don't know if it's out of compassion for Miss Marsh or if that's just his nature.

    So after a while, we all retreated into a silent contemplation of the landscape.

    I glance behind me every now and then to check on the others, when I notice the driver looking at me.

    When he realises I can see him, he quickly turns back to stare at the road.

    Am I imagining things, or is he blushing?
