    As I enter the room, I wonder why I've come here.

    To talk to other people?

    Right now, this feels too much for me.

    I check around the room and notice a chair that looks comfortable enough.

    So I sit there and look at what's happening in the room.

    Samuel Manning is moving around in an unsure manner.

    Most people are gathered around Captain Sinha, who is probably telling a war story.

    I see Ted Harring talking with the butler. 

    Then he looks over the room and catch me looking at him.

    He smiles and comes towards me.

    Oh gosh, now I'll have to talk to him.
