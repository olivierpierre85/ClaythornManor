    I wake up to the soft sound of someone moving around the room.
    
    Miss Marsh is already up, peeking through the slightly ajar door.

    Shh. They are moving.

    I get up quietly and join her.

    Ted Harring and Amelia Baxter are walking together, talking in low voices.
    
    They seem inseparable now.
    
    Captain Sinha follows some time later, alone. He looks tense.

    I glance at Miss Marsh. 
    
    She is perfectly still, her breathing shallow and controlled. 
    
    She knows exactly how to make herself invisible.
    
    It is impressive, and slightly unsettling.
    
    It feels like this is not the first time she has had to hide like this.

    They are heading downstairs. To the tea room, I assume.

    Should we join them?

    nurse """
    Not yet.
    
    Let's wait and see what they do. 
    
    I want to know if the Captain stays with them or if he goes off on his own.

    """
    So we wait.
    
    The hours tick by slowly.
