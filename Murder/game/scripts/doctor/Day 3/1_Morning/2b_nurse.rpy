    I wake up to the soft sound of someone entering the room.
    
    Miss Marsh is coming in.

    I just come from the dinner room, it's empty.

    In fact I didn't see anyone anywhere.

    No staff at all.

    How is it possible?

    Where could everyone has gone?

    That doesn't make sense.

    nurse """
    I don't know but it is indeed very suspicious.

    We were right to be cautious, something weird is definitely happening here.

    doctor """
    But what should we do then?

    Should we ....

    nurse """
    Shh. I hear someone coming.

    She puts her ear to the door.

    I get up quietly and join her.

    We hear two people walking together, talking in low voices.

    I recognise Ted Harring and Amelia Baxter.

    After they have passed, Rosalind Marsh confirms it.

    Ted Harring and Amelia Baxter.

    What are they doing here? There is no reason for them pass by my door.

    I don't like this.

    doctor """
    Maybe they're just looking for the staff.

    They must be as surprised as we are.
    """

    nurse """
    Maybe, but I don't know.

    It could be something else entirely.

    I don't really trust those two.
    
    I prefer if we avoided them at the moment.

    doctor """
    If it helps keeping your mind at ease why not.

    But what should we do instead?

    nurse """
    Well, we can't stay in this room.

    They might come looking here eventuelly.

    doctor """
    So what do you propose?

    nurse """
    I know a place where we can hide for a while until we know more.

    Very well. Were are we heading?

    Come with me, I'll show you.

    I glance at Miss Marsh. 
    
    She is perfectly still, her breathing shallow and controlled. 
    
    She knows exactly how to make herself invisible.

    It feels like this is not the first time she has had to hide like this.

    Not yet.
