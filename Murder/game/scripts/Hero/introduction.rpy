  As I approach Mandrake Manor, I am starting to have doubts about the whole trip.

  It is strange enough to be invited out of the blue, by someone I never heard of.

  But as I am in the back seat of a car driving to the Manor, I am an uneasy to find it to be so far from every where else.

  It must have been more than half an hour since we run into any places that looked habited.

  And to make matter worse, a look at the sky tells me that a storm is coming. 

  I grab the letter that is a the origin of this trip and read it again for the ten times.

  More information and thanks follow, but that's about the content of it.

  Well, I couldn't really say no to this amount of money. Certainly not now anyway. 
  
  So I feel like I didn't have much choice.

  But still, there is part of me thinking:

  Maybe I never should have come.
