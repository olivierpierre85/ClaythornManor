    # A DAY EARLIER 
    """
    I am looking at my brother, lifeless on his bed.

    His injuries had the best of him in the end.

    The mask that was suppose to help him live a normal live is next to him.

    He won't have to wear it anymore.

    That's not so bad, he couldn't bare the look of the people around him.

    After dedicated his youth to the army he ends up alone in his apartment.

    To scared to go out most of the time.

    The loneliness might have been the cause of death as much the failings of his aching body.

    I search about his place and found nothing that was not a necessity.

    There is a picture of us when we were kids, the caption reads: Thomas and Archibald spring 1870??)

    And a letter sits on his desk.

    Well he won't might me reading it now.

    I pick it up.
