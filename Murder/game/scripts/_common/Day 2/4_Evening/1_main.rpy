    Now that everyone is here, I want to express my deepest regret for what happened today.

    This isn't how I imagined our weekend.

    I don't believe any of us are in the mood for more entertainment.

    So, tomorrow morning, you'll receive your rewards.
    
    Afterward, we'll wait for the police to arrive.

    You're free to head home as soon as the officers give the all-clear.

    For now, enjoy your dinner.

    Drinks will be available in the billiard room afterwards, as they were yesterday.

    The food is served shortly after the speech.

    Yet, most of us have little appetite.

    Miss Baxter, I don't see Samuel Manning. 

    Do you know where he might be?

    psychic """
    He's locked in his room.

    After you left, there was a debate about how to handle him.
    
    Ultimately, we decided it best to confine him to his room.

    He didn't resist.

    That's where he is now. 

    It was agreed that his dinner would be served there.
