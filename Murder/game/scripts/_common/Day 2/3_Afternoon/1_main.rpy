    I swear it was! I have no idea how I could have hit him.
    
    I was aiming at a rabbit. I didn't even see him.

    You fool! You were probably too drunk, and that's why you hit him.

    You could barely walk this morning. Who gave you a gun?

    Please, there's no need to point fingers now. It's done.

    The police will handle it.

    No, not yet.

    We're still waiting for them.
