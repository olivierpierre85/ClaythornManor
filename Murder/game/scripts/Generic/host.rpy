  host """ 
  Welcome every one. I am sorry to have kept you waiting. Now that we are all gather here, I would like again to show you my gratitude.

  As you already know, you are all here because of an heroic act you've done in the past. 

  I took notice of what you've done and took upon me to give you a formal thank you.

  I know the letter inviting you was rather vague, so I will clarify it now.

  My first gift to you, is this stay in my manor. You will fully be catered too, with the most refine food expertly prepared by my personal cook.

  During the three days we will spend together, we'll also enjoy various activities I am sure you will love.

  The second gift, is a price of eight thousands pounds to share among yourselves. It's my way to thank people so selfless as to help other people.
