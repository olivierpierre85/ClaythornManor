    Oh my God! What happened!?

    Is that Doctor Baldwin? Is he injured?

    Oh no! Is he... dead?

    captain """
    I'm sorry, dear, but he is.

    psychic """
    But... what happened?
    """

    captain """
    It was an accident. 
    """

    drunk sad """
    I swear it was! I have no idea how I could have hit him.
    
    I was aiming at a rabbit. I didn't even see him.

    """
    Everyone turns to him.

    psychic angry """
    You fool! You were probably too drunk, and that's why you hit him.

    You could barely walk this morning. Who gave you a gun?
    """

    captain """
    Please, there's no need to point fingers now. It's done.

    The police will handle it.

    Speaking of which, has anyone from the city arrived yet?
    """

    nurse """
    No, not yet.

    We're still waiting for them.
    """

    captain """
    We should tell them to hurry.

    Lady Claythorn, where's the phone?
    """

    host """
    I'll handle it.

    """
    She leaves the group, with the butler following closely behind.

    The room falls silent.

    Most eyes are on Sam Manning, filled with disdain.

    Then, the hostess returns.

    host """
    I just spoke with the police. They aren't coming today.

    captain """
    What!? Why not?
    """

    host """
    They were on their way but encountered a huge tree blocking the road.
    
    They couldn't get past it.
    
    They said they'll be back tomorrow with assistance.

    psychic """
    But... what are we going to do with him until then?
    """

    captain """
    We'll move him to his bed for now. 
    
    It's the best we can do under the circumstances.

    Anyone willing to help?

    I will.
