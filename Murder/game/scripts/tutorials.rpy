    Congratulations, you've discovered your first piece of information about a character.

    Learning about a character is essential in this game.

    There are two different type of information : the important ones and the trivial ones.

    In order to \"unlock\" a new playable character, you must first learn all the important facts about them.

    That means that you will be able to restart the story from their point of view. 

    You can unlock some information while simply talking with a character.
    
    But some facts can only be discovered at specific moments of the story.

    You can see the percentage of important facts unlocked in the \"Characters\" Menu.
