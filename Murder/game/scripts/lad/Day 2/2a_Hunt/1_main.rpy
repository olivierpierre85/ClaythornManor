    Well I don't know if it's my best idea.

    But I couldn't stay behind with the ladies.

    """

    butler """
    So it's your first hunt mister Harring ?
    """
 
    lad """
    Yes indeed. I don't even know how to use a rifle.
    """

    butler """
    Don't worry sir. A footman will follow you and will reload the gun for you.
    
    All you have to do is point at you target when you encountered something, and pull the trigger.
    """

    lad """
    All right, that sounds easy enough. Will everyone have a footman as well ?
    """

    butler """
    No just you. I will be with Lady Claythorn and the others insisted they didn't need help.

    They all serve in the war I believe.
    """

    lad """
    I see. And what kind of animal are we hunting today ?
    """

    butler """
    I think we will encounter wild birds mostly. But we might also run into some deers or wild pigs.
    """

    lad """
    Aren't those dangerous ?
    """

    butler """
    Not if you don't get too close to them. And again you won't be alone, so there is no reason be scared.
    """
    lad """
    I am not scared, just curious
    """

    butler """
    Right. Anyway, you can pick up this gun and wear the clothes I lay down on the table.

    Come join the others outside when you are ready.
    """

    lad """
    Perfect, thanks
    """

    """
    I am trying the clothes before me. They fit perfectly.

    Well, I something happens to me, at least I'll look good.

    I'll go outside meet the others.
