# Doctor — Friday Evening (`doctor_day1_evening`)

The chapter opens in the tea room with `broken_generic_menu_doctor` (50-minute budget), then runs through Captain Sinha's arrival, the dinner gong, the dinner-table choice (`doctor_day1_evening` menu, 90-minute budget), and the post-dinner laudanum decision (`doctor_day1_evening_3`, 90-minute budget). After that comes `doctor_day1_evening_map_menu` (90-minute budget) for room exploration. The chapter ends with a flirt/book branching block before sleeping; the no-flirt-no-book fallback drops the doctor into `doctor_laudanum_death` for an automatic overdose.

The broken_generic budget (50 minutes) is too tight for a single-plan full Q&A, so the not-offended and offended branches are split across multiple plans.
