Chapter: The Arrival
Character: Ted Harring
Butler: Welcome, sir.
Ted Harring: Hello, I'm Ted Harring. I've been invited by Lady Claythorn.
Butler: Yes, of course, Mr Harring.
Butler: Welcome to Claythorn Manor.
Butler: I am afraid you won't have time to change right now.
Butler: Everyone is already there, and dinner will be ready very soon.
Butler: If you'll follow me to the tea room, you may join the rest of the party for some drinks.
Well, it's not as if I have multiple changes of clothes anyway. So, I follow him.
As I step into the room, the butler loudly announces me.
Butler: Mr Ted Harring!
Everyone turns their heads towards me.
Some people nod in my direction, while others barely acknowledge my presence.
From afar, the butler provides me with a brief introduction to each guest.
Butler: The older gentleman speaking is from India, and his name is Sushil Sinha.
Butler: He is in conversation with Rosalind Marsh...
Butler: ... and with Daniel Baldwin, the gentleman with spectacles.
Butler: Do not be alarmed by the man in the mask.
Butler: He is a war veteran, Mr Thomas Moody.
Butler: The person on the sofa, who looks rather exhausted, is Mr Samuel Manning.
Butler: The lady in the corner is Mrs Amelia Baxter.
Ted Harring: I don't see our host in the room.
Butler: Lady Claythorn is still busy at the moment.
Butler: You'll meet her at dinner.
After this introduction, he leaves me and goes to stand in the corner of the room.
Most of the guests are already engaged in conversation.
However, Amelia Baxter and Samuel Manning are alone.
They seem more approachable than the rest.
Menu Choice: Talk to Samuel Manning
I am heading towards the older man.
He holds an empty glass in his hand. His gaze is empty.
Ted Harring: Hello, sir. How are you?
Samuel Manning: (Snores...)
He reeks of booze, and he is deeply asleep. Talking to him is useless.
Menu Choice: Stand awkwardly in the corner
What is that? A gong?
Butler: Dinner is served. Please, follow me to the dining room.
Everyone takes a seat at the spot labelled with their names.
As I observe each person, Lady Claythorn makes her entrance into the room.
She looks younger than I had imagined.
I don't know why, but I pictured an elderly, bored lady. Yet she looks nothing like that.
Her clothes, which are the most impressive of anyone's in the room, make her status clear.
She proceeds to take her seat at the table.
Lady Claythorn: Welcome, everyone. My apologies for keeping you waiting.
Lady Claythorn: Now that we're all gathered, I'd like to express my gratitude once more.
Lady Claythorn: As you already know, you are here because of the heroic acts you've committed in the past.
Lady Claythorn: I've taken notice of these actions and felt it was my responsibility to extend a formal 'thank you.'
Lady Claythorn: I realize the invitation letter you received was somewhat vague, so let me clarify its contents now.
Lady Claythorn: My first gift to you is a stay at my manor.
Lady Claythorn: You'll be fully catered to, enjoying the most refined food, expertly prepared by my personal chef.
Lady Claythorn: During the three days we'll spend together, we'll also partake in various activities, which I'm sure you'll find enjoyable.
Lady Claythorn: My second gift is a sum of one thousand pounds, to be shared among you.
Lady Claythorn: This is my way of thanking those as selfless as yourselves, who help others without thought of reward.
Following her speech, our host settles back down in her chair.
After her speech, everyone appears pleased.
A few of the guests begin to express their appreciation to the host.
Lady Claythorn: Please, there's no need to thank me.
Lady Claythorn: The food will be served shortly.
Lady Claythorn: Enjoy your meal.
At that moment, the butler enters the room, accompanied by the footman.
They begin to serve the first dish and pour drinks for everyone.
The mood in the room gradually relaxes, and the sound of various conversations fills the space.
I turn my attention to the guests seated next to me.
I find myself sitting between Amelia Baxter and Daniel Baldwin.
Menu Choice: Talk to Daniel Baldwin
Ted Harring: Hello. I am Ted Harring.
Daniel Baldwin: Hi Mr Harring, I am Dr Daniel Baldwin.
Ted Harring: Nice to meet you, doctor.
Menu Choice: Tell me more about yourself.
Daniel Baldwin: I am the chief physician at St. Margaret's Hospital.
Daniel Baldwin: It's a charity hospital for those in need.
Daniel Baldwin: Before that, I worked a bit all over the place.
Daniel Baldwin: I also served in the army several times, including the last one.
Daniel Baldwin: That one was the worst, of course.
Menu Choice: Why were you invited here?
Daniel Baldwin: Well, I recently celebrated my ten years at St. Margaret's.
Daniel Baldwin: Not many people stay that long at this type of institution.
Daniel Baldwin: Usually, doctors stay for a few years to build a reputation, then move on to a more luxurious practice.
Daniel Baldwin: Lady Claythorn must have understood the sacrifice I've made, hence the reward.
Daniel Baldwin: Not that I consider it a sacrifice, of course.
Daniel Baldwin: I love my job and wouldn't change it for the world.
Daniel Baldwin: Still, it's always nice to receive some recognition.
Menu Choice: What do you think of this place?
Daniel Baldwin: It's a nice house.
Daniel Baldwin: But I can't say much more about it.
Daniel Baldwin: I'm not used to visiting such places.
Daniel Baldwin: This is the first time I've been invited to a grand mansion as a guest and not as a doctor.
Daniel Baldwin: The truth is, my job doesn't pay that much.
Daniel Baldwin: Nevertheless, I'm content with my small apartment.
Daniel Baldwin: I wouldn't want anything this big; it must be such a hassle to manage.
Ted Harring: So you're not accustomed to having a butler and footmen around?
Daniel Baldwin: No, I can't say that I am.
Well, that's rather comforting.
Menu Choice: What room are you in?
Daniel Baldwin: I'm staying in the Edward II room.
Menu Choice: What do you think of the other guests?
Daniel Baldwin: Oh, I haven't talked to many people so far.
Daniel Baldwin: I think the only person I've heard speak is Mr Sinha.
Daniel Baldwin: And by "heard," I really just mean heard.
Daniel Baldwin: Because I don't think I was able to contribute anything to the conversation.
Menu Choice: How old are you?
Daniel Baldwin: I'm 39 years old. Why do you ask?
Ted Harring: Actually, I'm not sure.
The dinner comes to an end.
The host explains that we can continue our discussion and enjoy drinks in the billiard room, or, for those tired from the journey, we can simply retire for the night.
Since I haven't seen my room yet, I should probably head there first.
I ask the footman to show me the way.
The footman escorts me up the grand staircase, leading me to the first floor.
Footman: Here you are, sir.
Footman: You've been assigned the 'William the Conqueror' room.
I step into the bedroom.
It is more spacious than my flat, and more luxurious than I could have imagined.
Footman: I hope the room suits your taste.
Ted Harring: This is... this is good, yes. Thank you.
The footman exits the room.
I look around in disbelief.
After a while, I unpack my modest luggage.
It does not take long. So, what should I do now?
Map Choice: Tea room
There is nobody here.
No need to stay any longer.
Map Choice: Library
It's a very nice library. But what am I doing here?
I can hardly read.
There is an open book on a small table.
"A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain."
Yeah, I'm not reading that.
I should probably look elsewhere.
Map Choice: Portrait Gallery
That's a creepy portrait gallery.
I don't recognize anyone, so I guess these are people from the Claythorn family.
Map Choice: Meet the others in the billiard room
Except for Amelia Baxter, everyone from dinner is in this room.
I recognise Dr Baldwin sitting alone in a chair.
There's also an array of alcohol near the bar.
The rest of the guests are clustered together, with Sushil Sinha leading the conversation.
The butler stands silently in a corner near them.
Menu Choice: Approach the large group of people
I walk towards the main group in the room.
Thomas Moody, Rosalind Marsh and Lady Claythorn are listening to the older Indian man.
Even the butler, who is standing in the corner next to them, looks very interested in what is being said.
I join them.
Sushil Sinha: Mr Harring.
Sushil Sinha: I was just telling everyone here a story.
Sushil Sinha: Where was I?
Sushil Sinha: Oh, right.
Sushil Sinha: It was in June of 1900, so some of you might remember.
Sushil Sinha: In China, a group of rebels, called the "Boxers," had taken up arms against foreign presence in their country.
Sushil Sinha: They were a group of mostly peasants, poorly armed.
Sushil Sinha: We called them "Boxers" because of their use of martial arts in their fights.
This appears to be a long story.
If I stay, I might be stuck here for a while.
Menu Choice: Continue to listen anyway
Sushil Sinha: They managed to surround the Europeans and Japanese in the "International Legations" quarter, in China's capital, Beijing.
Sushil Sinha: There, the besieged did their best to resist the Chinese assaults, but it was obvious to everyone that they wouldn't last very long.
Sushil Sinha: In order to break the siege and rescue their compatriots, the largest foreign nations formed expeditions to help lift the siege of Beijing.
Sushil Sinha: I was part of the most important one, and the only successful one: The "Gaselee Expedition," named after Alfred Gaselee, the British expedition leader.
Sushil Sinha: It was a mish-mash of troops from eight different countries: Japan, The British Empire, The United States, France, Russia, German Empire, Italy, and Austria-Hungary.
Sushil Sinha: As an Indian officer, I was obviously part of the British army.
Sushil Sinha: We first landed at Tientsin, the old Chinese capital.
Sushil Sinha: Then we marched from there to reach Beijing, and rescue the civilians besieged there, as well as people from previous expeditions.
Sushil Sinha: The journey was a total nightmare.
Sushil Sinha: We endured a march of almost a hundred miles, where we were under constant attacks from Chinese troops.
Sushil Sinha: If that wasn't bad enough, some poorly led and confused soldiers, notably from the French army, often ended up shooting at their allies.
Sushil Sinha: But the worst part was the scorching heat.
Sushil Sinha: Even my fellow Indian soldiers were not immune to it, and many died of sunstroke.
Sushil Sinha: By the time we reached Peking, our expedition of 20,000 had been reduced to 10,000.
Sushil Sinha: By that time, the soldiers were angry, tired, and restless.
Sushil Sinha: They had started to commit such acts that I can't even repeat here.
Sushil Sinha: I was expecting the exactions of the Japanese and the Russians, who were known for their ruthlessness.
Sushil Sinha: But in the end, our proud "civilized" European nations fared no better.
Sushil Sinha: The final assault of the besieged was also an example of a lack of discipline among the soldiers and their commanders.
Sushil Sinha: Each country was supposed to attack a different gate of the city.
Sushil Sinha: But the Russians were not happy with their assigned choice of gate.
Sushil Sinha: So they woke up early and assaulted the closest gate to the Legation Quarters, where the Americans were supposed to be.
Sushil Sinha: They wanted to be the first army to reach the defenders, and so claim the glory of having liberated the city by themselves.
Sushil Sinha: Bloody fools.
Sushil Sinha: Luckily, in the end, we managed to conquer Beijing without too much trouble.
Sushil Sinha: We even entered the Imperial City and rooted out the Empress.
Sushil Sinha: It was an undeniable victory, but the price paid was high.
Sushil Sinha: Afterwards, we stayed and occupied the city.
Sushil Sinha: To compensate themselves, the soldiers went on a looting frenzy.
Sushil Sinha: Sadly, people in the British army also took part in it.
Sushil Sinha: But not in the same outrageous manner as other nations.
Sushil Sinha: At least, looting on the part of British troops was carried out in the most orderly fashion.
Sushil Sinha: We held loot auctions every day except Sunday in front of the main gate to the British Legation.
Sushil Sinha: It was the best way to compensate for the loss of our compatriots who had suffered the siege for three months.
Sushil Sinha: There was no way around it, I'm afraid.
Sushil Sinha: Well, in any case, that was my first campaign as a captain.
Sushil Sinha: And I do not regret it.
Sushil Sinha: I stayed a few more months in China to ensure the peaceful transition.
Sushil Sinha: In the end, my commanders were really pleased with me.
Sushil Sinha: So, I was sent to London to lead a training regiment nearby.
Sushil Sinha: That was very rare for someone of Indian descent.
Sushil Sinha: In any case, that's why I live in England today.
Wait, that was the original question?
Why is he living in England?
That sure took long enough.
It's getting quite late now.
Going back to my room is probably the best thing to do.
It's been a long day and I'm exhausted from the trip.
So I change and get directly into bed.
Almost instantly, I fall asleep.
