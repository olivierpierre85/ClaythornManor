# Copilot Instructions for Murder Visual Novel Project

## Project Overview
- This is a Ren'Py-based visual novel project, with all main scripts and assets under the `game/` directory.
- The story, character logic, and UI are split across `.rpy` files and subfolders (see `scripts/`, `images/`, `audio/`, `gui/`).
- The project uses British English for all in-game text and code comments. Maintain this convention in all contributions.

## Key Directories & Files
- `scripts/`: Contains main story, character, and custom logic scripts. Subfolders group content by character or function.
- `images/`, `audio/`, `gui/`: Store visual and audio assets. Use these for referencing in scripts.
- `endings_conditions.py`: Python logic for determining story endings.
- `.rpyc` files are compiled Ren'Py scripts—never edit these directly.

## Coding & Text Conventions
- All dialogue and narration must use standard British English grammar and spelling.
- When fixing or generating dialogue, use triple quotes (`"""`) to separate lines, as per project settings.
- Do not use semicolons in dialogue or narration.
- Using simple quote (') instead of ’
- File and variable names use snake_case.
- In renpy dialogue, there is a blank line after each sentence.

## Character style and tone
- Maintain the tone and level of English in existing text; do not simplify or overcomplicate.
- Always change style when necessary.
- Characters have distinct styles and tones; maintain these when writing or editing dialogue.
- When rewriting dialogue, ensure it fits the character's established voice.
- each text block starts with the code name of the character, except when it is the inner voice speaking. In the case, the character used must be guessed based on the file or function name. (example: label doctor_day1_evening, the inner character is the doctor)
- Below is the description to follow for every characters. Note that we are in 1924, so the language must be adapted to the time period.

### doctor (Daniel Baldwin)
- He always speaks in a formal tone, using complete sentences.

### lad (Ted Harring)
- He uses informal language, often with slang and contractions.

### TODO OTHERS


## Developer Workflows
- Edit `.rpy` and `.py` files only; `.rpyc` files are auto-generated by Ren'Py.
- To test changes, launch the project in Ren'Py Launcher and run the game.
- For grammar or text improvements, follow the custom prompts in VS Code settings (see `settings.json`).
- Use the `saves/` directory for testing different story branches.

## Integration & Dependencies
- The project relies on Ren'Py (https://www.renpy.org/) for execution and asset management.
- Python scripts (e.g., `endings_conditions.py`) are used for advanced logic.
- No external build or test scripts are present; all workflows are managed via Ren'Py.

## Examples
- To add a new character, create a new `.rpy` file in `scripts/`, add assets to `images/characters/`, and reference them in the script.
- To update UI, modify assets in `gui/` and update `gui.rpy` or `screens.rpy` as needed.

## Additional Notes
- Always check for project-specific prompts or settings in `settings.json` before making text changes.
- If unsure about a convention, review similar files in the `scripts/` directory for examples.
