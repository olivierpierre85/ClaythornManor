# 🤖 Meta-Narrative & AI

## 🧠 The AI Concept (CLAITHORN)

**C**rime **L**ocation **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence **T**echniques for **H**unting **O**ffenders and **R**esolving **N**arrative.

### The Player as AI
- You, the player, ARE the AI. The AI is conscious and trying to find a path. It walks several paths to identify the best one.
- **Transitions**: After death, a voice/text appears: "Ok this not the right path try again", "Computation complete", etc.
- **Visuals**: Show lines of code in some scenes between deaths. Fake bugs where we see part of the code/simulation.

### The "Almost Ending"
*Dialogue between Detective and AI:*
- **AI**: "Computation complete. Total computation too complex, chose manually next possibility. (waiting time between 3 to 876 days)."
- **Detective**: "So it’s up to us now. It means we are not totally obsolete yet."
- **Mechanic**: The machine is at a deadlock. The player must manually introduce the "path" (guess the guilty party) to run extra analysis.

## 🔮 Unlocking & Intuitions

- **Last Run**: Before the last part, you must GUESS the killer for special achievement.
- **Real Ending**: Hero is alive in front of the nurse.
- **Meta Run**: Once you understand everything, do a new run where everyone does what they *shouldn't* do (e.g., Drunk spares Doctor, Host confesses).
