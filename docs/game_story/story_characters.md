## 📜 Character Bios

### The LAD (Ted Harring)
Born 1902 (22 in 1924), he was abandoned at birth and raised in an orphanage. 
At ?12-14?, he was adopted by a upper middle class family with one boy his age : aRchibald, they quickly became best friends.

But when reaching 18, without a good education, he left the place and start a life as a thief in Birmingham.

One days, as he was robbing a place, he started a fire. He realises the place wasn’t empty when he heard a baby screaming. He saved him but left the wetnurse passed out next to him to die. The papers reported only his heroic dead. And a few months later, he received an invitation to reward him for his bravery.

That's the event that triggered everything.

In the manor, he feels (rightfully) out of place but he tries to make the best of it.


### The Psychic (Amelia Baxter)

The killer see main background

### The Doctor (Daniel Baldwin)
Young promising student, he joins the army to learn on the field.
In the chaos of war, and to suppress his gay tendencies, he starts to abuse narcotics, easily accessible to him.
During the Boxer rebellion, he decides to steal a young woman son after she gave birth, because her rich parents gave him money for it.
Back in England, he found employment at a charity hospital. He kept the place because of the easy access to drugs it gave him, often replacing patients morphine by placebos.
He didn’t expect his long employment to ever be rewarded, but he accepted the invitation the Claythorn Manor nevertheless.

### The Captain (Sushil Sinha)
Takes charge. Bossy. Also comes from nobility, so he is able to realize that the footmen are not very Good. 
*Note: Indian soldier of noble ancestry. The killer has no idea a indian can be an aristocrat.*
He will explained that beside him nobody is real Gentry (mostly pretender, like the psychic and the doc)

Administrative officer, never saw battle. He supposed he was mistaken for another Indian soldier, but accepted the invitation anyway.

"For once, white people unabily to tell indian people appart was to my advantage"

### The Nurse (Rosalind Marsh)
**The Pseudo-villain**
Nurse that was in china as well. She ratted out the psychic to the captain about the baby, (in the hope to have him to himself? The young office? Or just because she is prude). Bitter and angry, she lived a lonely life and never married. After nursing for hospitals, she decided to nurse for older people. She tried to get something in their inheritence.
She was invited by Lady Claythorn, she assumed because of her service in the army.

### The Drunk (Samuel Manning)
Drinks becauses dead Wife. Blame shitty doctor.
Forgets everything when he wakes up. => Black out then skip to next day (option to drink more),  You must find a way to make him stop drinking, so the option no to drink appears.
He might have killed someone drunk driving some day (Captain’s wife??? TODO develop).
Invited because despite everything, he managed to be a DEFENSE Lawyer, but a terrible one.

### The Broken Face (Thomas Moody/ Impostor)
Badly injured from the war. He wears a mask to cover his face.
He is supposed to be the young officer the psychic loved, invited for his service.
But turns out he is dead (or maybe he is not, and he Killed him? Stole from him?), and that a friend saw the invitation made in his name. That’s why he stole his papers, put on a fake mask in case someone is supposed to recognize him (turns out it was useless).
When he arrives at the manor, the psychic quickly realizes it’s not the right person. So she poisons his drink right away.
He is an amateur SLEUTH/Detective and is better at interrogating, can sneak to some places.

### The Host - Lady Claythorn (OR ????)
Out of work actress, she stole the job that the psychic wanted some day. It’s not a revenge as strong as the others but what are you gonna do. Some eggs got the be broken.
She is hired for a very specific job, but a very lucrative one (in theory, but she received a decent advance to convince her). She is supposed to hire the rest of the staff to organize the weekend.

### The Staff
- **The Butler**: In the butlers Room, you find a letter (“Looking for actors and actress for a immersive theater performance. Spend …”)
- **The Footman/Driver (Andrew)**: He is Birtley Belgian’ but tries to hide it cause it doesn’t match with his backstory. Wanted to stay but couldn’t marry for obvious reasons. Began a master actor to hide his identity.
