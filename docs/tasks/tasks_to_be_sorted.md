## From NEXT TO STORY Ideas to implement

- [ ] **Map**: Add "You are here" on the map.

- TIME subtraction: Still a problem when starting a path with a menu a time < 0 ? It stop suddenly when a menu should be available? Try again to make the subtraction only at the end, like the time move? NO because then it allows to read a full menu? Like during no hunt? THINK THINK THINK


- Rename gun room to armory

- MOBILE version
    Important that the web version is mobile friendly, or I would lose so many players.
    MAKE IT Mobile First ! So the screen can be read in both format without changes?

- Servant stairs:
Make better image
Not everyone has access to it (Psychic, same downstairs)
Lad, needs to know about it, because it’s hidden. => you need to unlock somethin to access it (HOw did you manage to get there? Well I used the servant stairs of course)

- Create **NEW OPTIONS Page**

- REvise NEW **Help Page + Tutorials** 
    Fill with all the information needed
    Add IF for the parts that need a tutorial seen
    Move tutorial from script to tutorial page
    REWRITE Tutorials Based on new screen (characters, progress, …)


- **SECRET PASSAGE** ! Where are the staff, In a small room BEHIND servant stairs? Other?
All dead=> Who found them => Unlocks plenty?

- **Attic Knocking** : DOCTOR (and possibly everyone else) in ATTIC, they don’t knock ??? why? Check not weird => Or normal because we are exploring? NO add knocking => Maybe add no need to knock here, it’s for the servants

- Explain that restarting from a chapter doesn't mean all branches are accessibles from there

- Doctor Car crash  end. Add better sound when killed
