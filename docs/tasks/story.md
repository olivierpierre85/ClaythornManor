## Lad

### Important
- [ ] Add "Sir, do you know how to eat?" (footman interaction).
- [ ] After lad has entered every room: Notice his is the best of them all.
  - [ ] Just text or thread?
- [ ] Joke about the lad not knowing Roman Numbers (mistaking rooms).
- [ ] **Rosalind Marsh**: Add cough on "NO hunt",same as with psychic? + Explanation why nobody cares? (Not super important).
- [ ] **Transitions**: Day 2 morning transitions between Sam Manning and Doctor are too fast.
- [ ] **Discussion with Cpt Sinha (Day 2 Evening)**: Show generic choices, make the rest a submenu. Check if it works with Psychic.
- [ ] Dialog: "Can you read mister Harring? 'I GET BY'".

### Ideas to think over (optional)

- [ ] Make him afraid of ghosts.
    - [ ] Scared to go to the attic. Let him go once then cancel all attic choices.
- [ ] "So I tell her my story" => Only time doing that? Is it necessary?
- [ ] Add "you follow Daniel Baldwin" upstairs as an important choice, even for misdirect?
- [ ] **New Ending**: Snooping is bad!
    - [ ] "You can’t enter their room" (lad day3 morning) ALWAYS offer to open the door?
    - [ ] If spotted too many times (or right time) -> Arrest and death (Suspicious LAD DEATH).
- [ ] Get keys for the attic at the end? Lad can open locked doors, but won't at first (needs combination). Cheating -> Ending (assumed killer). Captain can force open.
- [ ] **Achievements**: Add achievement with all "Stand alone" choices.
- [ ] **Items/Inventory**: "Object drink on hand?" instead of unlock `day3_drunk` -> Add object glass of sherry for the last day (option to throw it?).
- [ ] **Attic**: Attic not closed, but only rooms closed? Add "First time in attic" label.
- [ ] **Gun Mechanics**:
    - [ ] More difference when you have gun for fell ending? Maybe need bullets?
    - [ ] Option to get in Captain's room/attic to get BULLETS (he sees you and kills you?) if you got bullets Day 2?
- [ ] **Billiard Room**: More options in TALK to butler? OR remove him entirely
- [ ] "Trust Psychic": Add more meaning, not just more time. Real ending possible only if trust?


## Psychic

### Important

- [ ] **Minor Day 2 Morning**: Specific other guest for everyone on day 2 evening with captain.
- [ ] **Day 2 Evening**: Ted Alliance Logic wobbly. Rewrite to keep consistent with Ted Harring Path.
- [ ] **Refactoring**: Better factorisation of `Common_day3_morning_lad_psychic_journey` and `Psychic_day3_morning_has_not_visited_lad`.
- [ ] **Day 1 Evening**: Lord path, second visit to portrait gallery/library => Other text when already visited?
- [ ] 
### Ideas to think over (optional)

- [ ] **The Lord**:
    - [ ] More story for the LORD? Add to list of playable characters? (Not easy but doable).
    - [ ] Need LORD QUESTIONS POSSIBLE.
- [ ] **Lad Interaction**: Visited LAD is not exploited enough.
    - [ ] First no differences in the morning day 3?
    - [ ] Mention the “talk” to your left first even when respected?
- [ ] **Rooms**: Add the rooms with the obvious choice BUT only if you went there with the Lad first? (Like the choice about the gun).
- [ ] **Unlockables**: "You left the manor while you could" (`leave_manor`) is used nowhere. Do we really need it?
- [ ] **Broken Room**: If not enough choices => add important choice "Error enter broken Room" => add macabre scene? (Replace `day2_has_seen_bedroom_broken`?).
- [ ] **Captain Sinha**: Be rude to him? Lead to an ending where he doesn’t want to go out with her?
- [ ] **Ted Harring**:
    - [ ] If you didn’t approach him, he’ll leave you alone? Then and only then you could escape?
    - [ ] Rewrite dialogs with Ted Harring?
    - [ ] When there is an alliance vs when there isn't => maybe another conclusion or option?
- [ ] **Mrs Baxter**: Make sure she was married. If yes, replace every Miss to Mrs Baxter.
- [ ] **Meta Logs**: For the Psychic, replace the logs with **“She talks to herself”** while talking to the lord? **YES VERY technical but also very cool**
- [ ] **Burning Ending**: Problem with music transition => SLOW down text? Add pauses?


## Doctor

### Important

### Ideas to think over (optional)
- [ ] ADD choice end of day1 when footman comes. Should I let him in ? This way the FRENCH thing is not mandatory

## 💡Generic Ideas
- [ ] Access to servants if you befriend one? (Doctor or Captain likely, NOT Lad).
- [ ] **Phone**: Where to put the phone? Add phone room? Basement?
- [ ] SOMETIMES, someone should be caught entering a room. 
- [ ] Rewrite the generic ENTER/don’t enter bedroom text by Character
- [ ] How come nobody is suspicious to receive an award, it’s not just the money. Deep down, everyone believe they deserve praise and glory for something they have done. It was just a matter of finding that thing for everyone.
- [ ] Thinking DO I need to say exactly the same things in the same way? Or the texts can be a bit different based on the character who sees it? Don’t, know, it’s not a story telling? 
- [ ] RIGHT place at the right time. Make SOME Important choices need to be timed exactly right. Example : Go to a room at 10:30 ( condition between 10h15 & 10h45)
- [ ] For everyone so far, when don’t change time AFTER a map_menu, because it doesn’t map sense. CHECK EVERY WHERE for everyone
- [ ] Well, if we check everyone backstory, and we can figure out who is not an impostor, then we can reveal the murderer
- [ ] Should add   mention of drinks in tea room for lad and psychic? DAY 1 evening?
- [ ] In later characters,Discuss the “INTuitions” and how sometimes we are compelled to do something that goes against everything we are or believe in.
