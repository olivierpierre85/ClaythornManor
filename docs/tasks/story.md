## Lad

### Important
- [ ] Add "Sir, do you know how to eat?" (footman interaction).
- [ ] After lad has entered every room: Notice his is the best of them all.
  - [ ] Just text or thread?
- [ ] Joke about the lad not knowing Roman Numbers (mistaking rooms).
- [ ] **Rosalind Marsh**: Add cough on "NO hunt",same as with psychic? + Explanation why nobody cares? (Not super important).
- [ ] **Transitions**: Day 2 morning transitions between Sam Manning and Doctor are too fast.
- [ ] **Discussion with Cpt Sinha (Day 2 Evening)**: Show generic choices, make the rest a submenu. Check if it works with Psychic.
- [ ] Dialog: "Can you read mister Harring? 'I GET BY'".

### Ideas to think over (optional)

- [ ] Make him afraid of ghosts.
    - [ ] Scared to go to the attic. Let him go once then cancel all attic choices.
- [ ] "So I tell her my story" => Only time doing that? Is it necessary?
- [ ] Add "you follow Daniel Baldwin" upstairs as an important choice, even for misdirect?
- [ ] **New Ending**: Snooping is bad!
    - [ ] "You can’t enter their room" (lad day3 morning) ALWAYS offer to open the door?
    - [ ] If spotted too many times (or right time) -> Arrest and death (Suspicious LAD DEATH).
- [ ] Get keys for the attic at the end? Lad can open locked doors, but won't at first (needs combination). Cheating -> Ending (assumed killer). Captain can force open.
- [ ] **Achievements**: Add achievement with all "Stand alone" choices.
- [ ] **Items/Inventory**: "Object drink on hand?" instead of unlock `day3_drunk` -> Add object glass of sherry for the last day (option to throw it?).
- [ ] **Attic**: Attic not closed, but only rooms closed? Add "First time in attic" label.
- [ ] **Gun Mechanics**:
    - [ ] More difference when you have gun for fell ending? Maybe need bullets?
    - [ ] Option to get in Captain's room/attic to get BULLETS (he sees you and kills you?) if you got bullets Day 2?
- [ ] **Billiard Room**: More options in TALK to butler? OR remove him entirely
- [ ] "Trust Psychic": Add more meaning, not just more time. Real ending possible only if trust?


## Psychic
### Important
- [ ] **Minor Day 2 Morning**: Specific other guest for everyone on day 2 evening with captain.
- [ ] **Day 2 Evening**: Ted Alliance Logic wobbly. Rewrite to keep consistent with Ted Harring Path.
- [ ] **Refactoring**: Better factorisation of `Common_day3_morning_lad_psychic_journey` and `Psychic_day3_morning_has_not_visited_lad`.
- [ ] **Day 1 Evening**: Lord path, second visit to portrait gallery/library => Other text when already visited?
### Ideas to think over (optional)
- [ ] **The Lord**:
    - [ ] More story for the LORD? Add to list of playable characters? (Not easy but doable).
    - [ ] Need LORD QUESTIONS POSSIBLE.
- [ ] **Lad Interaction**: Visited LAD is not exploited enough.
    - [ ] First no differences in the morning day 3?
    - [ ] Mention the “talk” to your left first even when respected?
- [ ] **Rooms**: Add the rooms with the obvious choice BUT only if you went there with the Lad first? (Like the choice about the gun).
- [ ] **Unlockables**: "You left the manor while you could" (`leave_manor`) is used nowhere. Do we really need it?
- [ ] **Broken Room**: If not enough choices => add important choice "Error enter broken Room" => add macabre scene? (Replace `day2_has_seen_bedroom_broken`?).
- [ ] **Captain Sinha**: Be rude to him? Lead to an ending where he doesn’t want to go out with her?
- [ ] **Ted Harring**:
    - [ ] If you didn’t approach him, he’ll leave you alone? Then and only then you could escape?
    - [ ] Rewrite dialogs with Ted Harring?
    - [ ] When there is an alliance vs when there isn't => maybe another conclusion or option?
- [ ] **Mrs Baxter**: Make sure she was married. If yes, replace every Miss to Mrs Baxter.
- [ ] **Meta Logs**: For the Psychic, replace the logs with **“She talks to herself”** while talking to the lord? **YES VERY technical but also very cool**
- [ ] **Burning Ending**: Problem with music transition => SLOW down text? Add pauses?

## Doctor
- [ ] Add 1 or 2 times where doc takes drugs on day 3.
- [ ] Retry everything.
- [ ] Withdrawal mechanics vs Drug mechanics.

## Nurse
- [ ] Stealing mechanic (counter).
- [ ] Chase path (Hide in scullery).
- [ ] She talks to Lady Claythorn on the first Day (When?).

## 💡Generic Ideas
- [ ] Access to servants if you befriend one? (Doctor or Captain likely, NOT Lad).
- [ ] **Phone**: Where to put the phone? Add phone room? Basement?
