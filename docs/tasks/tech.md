## Big Ideas (High impact)


### (Minor) (hard) Unlock intuition
An INTUITION in a timeline can CHANGE multiple timelines
Build a screen to unlock intuitions !!!! Yes, some will have a positive effect some not really => Similar bad end theater
Or put it in the CHARACTER screen, add an intuition button on off


### (Minor) (hard) Position of people on map
For each chapters (part of chapter when complicated) there is only one possible position for each character. When you find out where they are, it should be written on the map. Otherwise, the map unlock is not very useful. Test if possible
Very complicated => Maybe for version 2

### (Minor) DEAD PEOPLE IN MENU
For each chapter, at every moment, Show the people who are dead and the one alived in the progress view (add a cross if character dead), a question mark if you don't know where they are

### TIME subtraction: 
- Still a problem when starting a path with a menu a time < 0 ? It stop suddenly when a menu should be available? Try again to make the subtraction only at the end, like the time move? NO because then it allows to read a full menu? Like during no hunt? THINK THINK THINK
