## Locations with characters inside (Experimental)
- Once we have locations and character, use whisk to put full size characters inside the locations.
Do it for all possibilities ( dining room with less and less persons as the time goes by,...)


## Animations

- Make small movies with meaningful transitions : car arrival to manor with thunder in the background. Violent death/
- Note need to turn mp4 into webdm. A video is about 3 mb. (HOw many do I need before it begins too much? A think even 100 videos should be ok.

## Maps 
- When ALL rooms in the game are defined, create sensical maps. May need to redraw door on certain locations, that should take too long start making maps in the exact same style (not that easy)

## (Optional) Rebuild Icons ?
- [ ] ?

## (Optional) Rebuild Interface
- [ ] ?

## (Optional) One Style by character
- If enough time and money, each character should have a different style of room. That means 8 times each location. That's quite a lot of work
- For instance: If lad, everything looks **amazing**, for rest not so much. For psychic, weird things appear from time to time


## 🔊 Music / Sound

### Sound
- [ ] Better gun sound.
- [ ] Snore noise for Sam Manning and pretend snore for lad.
- [ ] Better sound for CLOCK rotating.
- [ ] Better agony cry (hunt)
- [ ] Doctor Car crash  end. Add better sound when killed
- [ ] Better sound for CLOCK rotating, not clear enough apparently

### Music
- [ ] Check every music choice (Hunt, Ending, Speed run).
- [ ] Download AVIA copyright (50 for 1 month)
- [ ] Add a Special music for "you survived"?
- [ ] SCarier music for when drunk dies of a slashed throat





## (obsolete) Current Map 

- [ ] Dungeon Scrawl map generator (link).
- [ ] Fix alignment for Elisabeth and others.
- [ ] Drop wall shadows.
- [ ] Add Manor name on the right.
- [ ] Remove too many doors for the downstairs servants stairs.
