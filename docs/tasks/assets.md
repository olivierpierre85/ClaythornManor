# 🎨 Assets Backlog

## 🖼️ Visual Asset generations (AI Plan)
### Locations
- Redraw all location, from current map.
- Add a Time for each location (day, night), should be automated when change room
- Find a style explanation that will work everytime

#### Still to do
- [ ] All

### Characters
- From their heads, create full size avatar in the style. Also redraw the head with new style and add all needed expressions: Scared, amused, sad,....
- Maybe have their side head of people out of the frame (like in “see how they run movie”)

#### Still to do
- [ ] All

### Locations with characters inside (Experimental)
- Once we have locations and character, use whisk to put full size characters inside the locations.
Do it for all possibilities ( dining room with less and less persons as the time goes by,...)

#### Still to do
- [ ] All

### Animations

- Make small movies with meaningful transitions : car arrival to manor with thunder in the background. Violent death/
- Note need to turn mp4 into webdm. A video is about 3 mb. (HOw many do I need before it begins too much? A think even 100 videos should be ok.

#### Still to do
- [ ] All

### Maps 
- When ALL rooms in the game are defined, create sensical maps. May need to redraw door on certain locations, that should take too long start making maps in the exact same style (not that easy)

#### Still to do
- [ ] All


### (Optional) Rebuild Icons ?
- [ ] ?

### (Optional) Rebuild Interface
- [ ] ?

### (Optional) One Style by character
- If enough time and money, each character should have a different style of room. That means 8 times each location. That's quite a lot of work
- For instance: If lad, everything looks **amazing**, for rest not so much. For psychic, weird things appear from time to time



## 🔊 Music / Sound

### Sound
- [ ] Better gun sound.
- [ ] Snore noise for Sam Manning and pretend snore for lad.
- [ ] Better sound for CLOCK rotating.
- [ ] Better agony cry (hunt

### Music

- [ ] Download AVIA copyright (50 for 1 month)
