# 🎨 Assets Backlog

## 🖼️ Visual Asset generations (AI Plan)
### Locations
- Redraw all location, from current map.
- Add a Time for each location (day, night), should be automated when change room
- Find a style explanation that will work everytime

| Location      |  Day  | Night | Rain/ Storm # |
| ------------- | :---: | :---: | :-----------: |
| Inside Train  |   x   |   -   |       -       |
| Train Station |       |       |               |
| .....         |       |       |               |

### Characters
- From their heads, create full size avatar in the style. Also redraw the head with new style and add all needed expressions: Scared, amused, sad,....
- Maybe have their side head of people out of the frame (like in “see how they run movie”)

### Locations with characters inside (Experimental)
- Once we have locations and character, use whisk to put full size characters inside the locations.
Do it for all possibilities ( dining room with less and less persons as the time goes by,...)



### Animations

- Make small movies with meaningful transitions : car arrival to manor with thunder in the background. Violent death/
- Note need to turn mp4 into webdm. A video is about 3 mb. (HOw many do I need before it begins too much? A think even 100 videos should be ok.

### Maps 
- When ALL rooms in the game are defined, create sensical maps. May need to redraw door on certain locations, that should take too long start making maps in the exact same style (not that easy)

### (Optional) Rebuild Icons ?
- [ ] ?

### (Optional) Rebuild Interface
- [ ] ?

### (Optional) One Style by character
- If enough time and money, each character should have a different style of room. That means 8 times each location. That's quite a lot of work
- For instance: If lad, everything looks **amazing**, for rest not so much. For psychic, weird things appear from time to time

## UI (TODO move to TECH)

- [ ] **Map**: Add "You are here" on the map.
- [ ] **MOBILE version**
    Important that the web version is mobile friendly, or I would lose so many players.
    MAKE IT Mobile First ! So the screen can be read in both format without changes?
- [ ] Create **NEW OPTIONS Page**
- [ ] REvise NEW **Help Page + Tutorials** 
    Fill with all the information needed
    Add IF for the parts that need a tutorial seen
    Move tutorial from script to tutorial page
    REWRITE Tutorials Based on new screen (characters, progress, …)
- **Tutorial** Explain that restarting from a chapter doesn't mean all branches are accessibles from there

## 🔊 Music / Sound

### Sound
- [ ] Better gun sound.
- [ ] Snore noise for Sam Manning and pretend snore for lad.
- [ ] Better sound for CLOCK rotating.
- [ ] Better agony cry (hunt)
- [ ] Doctor Car crash  end. Add better sound when killed
- [ ] Better sound for CLOCK rotating, not clear enough apparently

### Music
- [ ] Check every music choice (Hunt, Ending, Speed run).
- [ ] Download AVIA copyright (50 for 1 month)
- [ ] Add a Special music for "you survived"?
- [ ] SCarier music for when drunk dies of a slashed throat

## Generic Ideas (TODO SORT (maybe move some to TECH))
- Rename gun room to armory
- Servant stairs:
Make better image
Not everyone has access to it (Psychic, same downstairs)
Lad, needs to know about it, because it’s hidden. => you need to unlock somethin to access it (HOw did you manage to get there? Well I used the servant stairs of course)
- **Choices**: Dinner and other multiple generic choices: Keep alive or not? If not player can be frustrated but maybe we lose immersion with it.
- **doctor** : Remove intuition from burning image, or make better image
- Replace ALL icons, with the thread icon? Not loops, or .... (just do)
- Redo The buttons at the bottom of the say dialog
- TRAIN : Different picture by 1st (Cpatain?), 2nd (Most people) and 3 class (Ted Harring)
- Add Icon for web distribution
- Thomas Moddy new face is greenish and too soft, Make it better AND the same everywhere (it’s the old version in the info_cards)
- ? CHARACTER SCREEN should represent the Dinner table positions
- IN PROGRESS, Make the chapter image 20% bigger so the text on two lines can be bigger (28 instead of 26, 

- ?Replace the —- for the missing description by a redacted marker? 


## (obsolete) Current Map 

- [ ] Dungeon Scrawl map generator (link).
- [ ] Fix alignment for Elisabeth and others.
- [ ] Drop wall shadows.
- [ ] Add Manor name on the right.
- [ ] Remove too many doors for the downstairs servants stairs.

### Info
Manor MAP generator
